They learn statistical patterns of language so they can generate coherent sentences, answer questions, or even brainstorm ideas. Key points to understand:</p> <ol> <li>Training Data: LLMs ingest terabytes of text (web pages, books, articles). This \u201cworld knowledge\u201d lets them respond on many topics.  </li> <li>Tokenization: Text is broken into smaller units called tokens (words, subwords, or characters). The model predicts one token at a time.  </li> <li>Context Window: Each LLM has a limit on how many tokens it can \u201csee\u201d at once. Beyond that limit, prior tokens get truncated.  </li> <li>Prompting: You interact with an LLM by sending it a prompt. The better your prompt, the more focused and relevant the response.  </li> <li>Zero-shot vs. Fine-tuning: Zero-shot means using an LLM as-is (just raw weights). Fine-tuning means adjusting the model on domain-specific data so it answers more accurately for your needs.</li> </ol> <p>Pro Tip: A common analogy is that an LLM is like a \u201csuper-smart autocomplete.\u201d It doesn\u2019t truly understand meaning like a human brain, but it\u2019s extremely good at predicting the next best word (or phrase) in a sequence.</p>"},{"location":"01-introduction-to-agents/#retrieval-augmented-generation-rag","title":"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)","text":"<p>When LLMs rely solely on static training data, they might hallucinate or become outdated. RAG addresses this by letting the model \u201clook up\u201d fresh information before composing an answer.

Solutions are essential for Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), they enable you to manage your app and agents from idea to development, testing, deployment, and updates.</p> <p>In Copilot Studio, every agent you create is stored in a Power Platform solution. By default, agents are created in the Default solution, unless you create a new custom solution to create your agent in. This is what we'll learn \ud83e\udd13 in this lesson and in the hands-on lab.</p> <p>Solutions traditionally have been created in the Power Apps maker portal - a web based interface where you can build and customize apps, Dataverse, flows, explore AI components and more.</p> <p></p> <p>In Copilot Studio, there is now the Solution Explorer where you can manage your solutions directly. You no longer need to switch to the Power Apps maker portal to manage your solutions, it can be done right inside Copilot Studio \ud83e\ude84</p> <p>This means you can do the usual solution-related tasks:</p> <ul> <li>Create a solution - custom solutions enable agents to be exported and imported between environments.</li> <li>Set your preferred solution - choose the solution agents, apps, etc will be created in by default.</li> <li>Add or remove components - your agent could be referencing other components such as environment variables or cloud flows. Therefore these components needed to be included in the solution.</li> <li>Export solutions - to move solutions to another target environment.</li> <li>Import solutions - import solutions created elsewhere, including upgrading or updating solutions.</li> <li>Create and manage solution pipelines - automate the deployment of solutions between environments.</li> <li>Git integration - enables developers to connect solutions with Git repositories for version control, collaboration and ALM. Intended to be used in developer environments only.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>There are two types of solutions:</p> <ul> <li>Unmanaged solutions - used during development. You can freely edit and customize as needed.</li> <li>Managed solutions - used when you're ready to deploy your app to testing or production.

I'll help you with that.</code></li> </ul> <p>This node lets your agent send messages to users, which can be simple text or rich content like images, videos, cards, quick replies and adaptive cards.</p> <p>You can personalize messages using variables, add multiple message variations for variety, and even customize speech output for voice-enabled channels.</p> <p>Think of it as a \"say something\" block that helps your agent communicate clearly and interactively with users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask a question</p> <ul> <li>Purpose - asks the user a question and waits for their answer.</li> <li>Example - <code>What are your vacation dates?</code></li> </ul> <p>This node is used to ask users for specific information during a conversation and store their responses in variables for later use.</p> <p>You can customize the type of question like text input or use entities for a defined list of values a user selects from, and define how the agent should behave if the user gives an invalid answer or skips the question.</p> <p>It also supports rich content like images and quick replies, and lets you fine-tune validation, reprompting, and interruption settings to make the conversation flow smoothly.</p> <p>Think of it as an \"ask and listen\" block that helps your agent interact with users in a structured way that you define.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask with adaptive card</p> <ul> <li>Purpose - send a rich, interactive card using JSON.</li> <li>Example - a card that displays a calendar date picker for a user to select a date.</li> </ul> <p>This node shows rich, interactive cards that users can fill out and submit such as forms with text boxes, buttons, and images. It captures the user's input and stores it in variables, which your agent can use later in the conversation.</p> <p>Think of it as a customizable \"form builder\" block that makes your agent more engaging and capable of collecting detailed information from users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add a condition</p> <ul> <li>Purpose - add logic to the conversation. It checks something and decides what to do next.</li> <li>Example - if the user says <code>Yes</code>, go to the next step. If <code>No</code>, end the conversation.</li> </ul> <p>This node creates decision points in your agent's conversation flow by checking if a variable meets certain criteria. Based on whether the condition is true or false, the agent follows different paths.</p> <p>Think of it as an \"if-else\" block that helps your agent make descisions depending on user input or stored data in variables.</p> </li> <li> <p>Variable management</p> <ul> <li>Purpose - stores or clears information (called variables) during the conversation.</li> <li>Example - saves the date the user selected in the Ask a question node that displays an adaptive card.</li> </ul> <p>This node lets you store and manage information during a conversation, it could be a user's name, answer, or preferences.

It helps guide users through different parts of the conversation flow by smoothly transitioning between topics, and you can pass variables between them to keep context.</p> <p>Think of it as a \"go to another section/step\" block that helps your agent be flexible in chatting with users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add a tool</p> <ul> <li>Purpose - connects to external tools such as Power Automate, Excel, ServiceNow.</li> <li>Example - Power Automate cloud flow executed after user submits their vacation leave request.</li> </ul> <p>This node gives your agent capabilities to interact with external systems or perform specific tasks, such as sending emails, checking weather, or accessing databases.

It can be used as a fallback when no matching topic is found, or within a topic to provide more detailed, dynamic answers based on specific sources you've configured your agent to use.</p> <p>Think of it as a \"smart answer block\" that helps your agent give helpful, accurate responses by searching trusted content you define.</p> </li> <li> <p>HTTP request node</p> <ul> <li>Purpose - connect your agent to external systems by sending API calls (for example <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>) to fetch or update data.</li> <li>Example - when a user asks for their vacaction days balance, the agent performs a <code>GET</code> request to the leave management system and extracts the <code>remainingLeaveDays</code> from the API response and replies to the user with the value.</li> </ul> <p>This node lets your agent connect to external systems by sending REST API calls, like <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> requests. You can customize the request with headers, body content, and even use Power Fx to include dynamic data, then store the response in variables for use later in the conversation.</p> <p>Think of it as a \"reach out and get information\" block that helps your agent talk to other services such as retrieving user details or sending data to another system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Send an event</p> <ul> <li>Purpose - lets your agent send non-message actions, such as system updates or tool triggers - to the client or channel, helping it perform tasks.</li> <li>Example - reacting to a user joining a chat by displaying a welcome a message.</li> </ul> <p>This node lets your agent send non-message actions to external systems or channels, which can then decide how to respond. You give each event a name and attach a value, which can be a simple number or text, a variable, or a Power Fx formula, and it gets sent as a JSON object.</p> <p>Think of it as a \"silent trigger\" block that helps your agent do things behind the scenes or communicate with external tools without needing a user to say anything.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"07-add-new-topic-with-trigger/#using-power-fx-in-your-nodes","title":"\ud83c\udfcb\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Using Power Fx in your nodes","text":"<p>In Copilot Studio, Power Fx is a low-code programming language used to add logic and dynamic behaviour to your agent.
