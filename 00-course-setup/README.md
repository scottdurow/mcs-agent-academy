## Step 1: Get a Microsoft 365 Account

Copilot Studio resides within Microsoft 365, so you need a Microsoft 365 account to access it. You can either use an existing account if you have one or follow these steps to get an appropriate license:

1. **Acquire a Paid Microsoft 365 Business Subscription**  
   1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 Business Plans and Pricing Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-plans-and-pricing) 
   1. The cheapest option to get you started is the Microsoft 365 Business Basic plan. Select `Try for free` and walk through the guided form to fill in your subscription and account details and payment information.

   1. Once you have your new account, login. 

> **Tip:** If you plan to publish agents into Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat or connect to organizational data (SharePoint, OneDrive, Dataverse), a Microsoft 365 Copilot license is required. This is an add-on license which you can learn more about [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot#plans)

## Step 2: Start a Copilot Studio Trial

Once you have your M365 Tenant, you need to get access to Copilot Studio. You can get a free 30 day trial by following these steps:

1. Navigate to [aka.ms/TryCopilotStudio](https://aka.ms/TryCopilotStudio).  
1. Enter the email address from the new account you configured in the previous step and select `Next`.

![Microsoft 365 Signup](./images/mcs-trial-signin.png)  
1. Select `Start Free Trial`. 
![Microsoft 365 Signup](./images/mcs-start-trial.png) 

> **Trial Notes:**  
> 1. The free trial provides **full Copilot Studio capabilities**.  
> 1. You will receive email notifications about your trial expiration. You can extend the trial in 30-day increments (up to 90 days of agent runtime).  
> 1. If your tenant administrator disabled self-service sign-up, you’ll see an error—contact your Microsoft 365 admin to re-enable it.

## Step 3: Create new SharePoint site

A new SharePoint site needs to be created  which will be used in [Lesson 06 - Create a custom agent using the conversational creation experience with Copilot and grounding it with your data](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-studio-for-beginners/blob/main/06-create-agent-from-conversation/README.md#62-add-an-internal-knolwedge-source-using-a-sharepoint-site---for-microsoft-365-licensed-users-with-sharepoint).

1. Select the waffle icon on the top left hand side of Microsoft Copilot Studio to view the menu. Select SharePoint from the menu.

   ![Select ShraePoint](images/00_03_01_SelectSharePoint.png)

1. SharePoint will load. Select **+ Create  site** to create a new SharePoint site.

   ![Create site](images/00_03_02_CreateSite.png)

   ![IT help desk template](images/00_03_04_SelectITHelpDeskTemplate.png)

1. Select **Use template** to create a new SharePoint site using the IT help desk template.

   ![Use template](images/00_03_05_SelectUseTemplate.png)

1. Enter information for your site. The following is an example:

    | Field | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Site name | Contoso IT |
    | Site description | Copilot Studio for Beginners |
    | Site address | ContosoIT |

   ![Site information](images/00_03_06_SiteDetails.png)

1. In the final step, a language can be selected for the SharePoint site. By default it will be **English**. Leave the Language as **English** and select **Create site**,

   ![Language and other options](images/00_03_07_LanguageOtherOptions.png)

1. The SharePoint site will provision for the next few seconds. In the mean time, you can choose to add other users to your side by entering their email address in the **Add members** field. When completed, select **Finish**.

   ![Select finish](images/00_04_08_SelectFinish.png)

1. The SharePoint site home page will next load. **Copy** the SharePoint site URL.

1. This template provides pages with sample data about various IT policies and two sample lists (Tickets and Devices). 

   We will use the **Devices** list for in [Lesson 07 - Add new topic with trigger and nodes](/07-add-new-topic-with-trigger/README.md/#73-add-node---add-a-tool-using-a-connector). 

   You need to make sure you fill in this list with at least 4 sample data items and add one additional column to this list.
   
   Scroll to the far right in the list and select the **+ Add column** button.  Choose the **hyperlink** type, enter **Image** for the column name, and select add.  

   When adding sample data, make sure that the following fields are filled out: 
      - Device photo - use the images from the [device images folder](/00-course-setup/images/device-images/)
      - Title
      - Status
      - Manufacturer
      - Model
      - Asset Type
      - Color
      - Serial Number
      - Purchase Date
      - Purchase Price, 
      - Order # 
      - Image
