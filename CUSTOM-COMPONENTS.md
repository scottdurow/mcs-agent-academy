# Custom Components Reference

This document describes every custom component and special markdown syntax available in the Agent Academy documentation. These components are built on [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) with custom Vue plugins.

## Custom Vue components

### `<mission-meta />`

Renders a metadata card showing the mission's codename, difficulty rating, estimated time, and taxonomy pills (products, tags, industries). It reads all values directly from the page's YAML frontmatter — no props are needed.

**Usage:**

```markdown
# 🚨 Mission 01: Introduction to Agents

<mission-meta />
```

**Frontmatter fields used:**

| Field | What it renders |
|-------|-----------------|
| `codename` | 🕵️ badge with the operation name |
| `difficulty` | Star rating out of 3 (⭐). Only values 1–3 render stars — 4 and 5 render none. |
| `time` | ⏱️ label with a pie-chart icon. The pie fills proportionally — 60 minutes = full circle. |
| `products` | Linked pills pointing to `/products/{slug}/` |
| `tags` | Linked pills pointing to `/tags/{slug}/` |
| `industries` | Linked pills pointing to `/industries/{slug}/` |

The component renders only when at least one of these fields is present. Label lookups use `docs/.vitepress/data/products.json`, `tags.json`, and `industries.json`.

> [!NOTE]
> `<mission-meta />` uses a 3-star scale, while `<missions />` cards and `scripts/validate-frontmatter.mjs` allow `difficulty` values up to 5. Keep course and mission difficulty in the 1–3 range so the stars render.

**When to use:** Place immediately after the H1 title on every mission page (courses, Special Ops, and Cowork Collective).

**Preview:**

---

### `<missions />`

Renders a filterable, paginated grid of mission cards. Each card shows the mission's section badge, title, difficulty stars, badge image, date, and a `PREVIEW` pill when the mission sets `preview` in its frontmatter.

**Props:**

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `section` | string | — | Filter missions by section: `recruit`, `operative`, `special-ops`, or `cowork-collective`. |
| `sort` | string | `"alphabetical"` | Sort field. Options: `"alphabetical"`, `"last-updated"`, `"level"`, `"first-added"`. |
| `order` | string | `"ascending"` | Sort direction: `"ascending"` or `"descending"`. |
| `maxRows` | number | `2` | Maximum rows per page. Enables pagination when set. |
| `filterable` | boolean | `true` | Show filter pills for tags, products, and industries. |
| `filtersExpanded` | boolean | `false` | Whether the filter panel starts expanded. When collapsed, an active-filter count badge is shown. |
| `tag` | string | — | Pre-filter by a tag slug (for example `fundamentals`). |
| `product` | string | — | Pre-filter by a product slug (for example `copilot-studio`). |
| `industry` | string | — | Pre-filter by an industry slug (for example `it`). |

**Examples:**

Show all Special Ops missions, newest first:

```markdown
<missions section="special-ops" sort="first-added" order="descending" />
```

Show Recruit missions filtered to a specific tag:

```markdown
<missions section="recruit" filterable="true" tag="fundamentals" />
```

Show all missions with pagination (4 rows per page):

```markdown
<missions maxRows="4" />
```

**When to use:** On section landing pages (`docs/special-ops/index.md`, `docs/cowork-collective/index.md`, etc.) and any taxonomy pages that list missions.

Missions with `hide: true` in their frontmatter are excluded from every `<missions />` grid, including section, tag, product, and industry listings. The mission page remains available directly, and its `<mission-meta />` component is unaffected.

The `commander-preview`, `recruit-v2`, and `operative-v2` folders are excluded from mission data entirely by `EXCLUDED_DIRS` in `docs/.vitepress/plugins/missions/index.ts`, so those missions never appear in a grid and passing one of those slugs to `section` returns nothing.

**Preview:**

![Missions grid with filter pills and mission cards](./assets/component-missions.png)

---

### `<analytics-tag />`

Renders a tracking pixel image for page-level analytics.

**Props:**

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `section` | string | Yes | Analytics section name (for example `recruit`, `special-ops`, `cowork-collective`). |
| `mission` | string | No | Optional mission identifier for detailed tracking. |

**Examples:**

Track a landing page:

```markdown
<analytics-tag section="cowork-collective" />
```

Track a specific mission:

```markdown
<analytics-tag section="special-ops" mission="yaml-specialist" />
```

**When to use:** Place at the very end of every page, after all other content.

---

### `<action-button />`

Renders a styled link button with brand colors. External links (`http`/`https`) automatically open in a new tab with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

**Props:**

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `href` | string | — | Link URL. Required. |
| `label` | string | — | Button text. Required. |
| `icon` | string | — | Optional emoji displayed before the label. |
| `external` | boolean | — | Force external link behavior (new tab). When omitted, auto-detected from `href`. |

**Examples:**

Internal link (opens in same tab):

```markdown
<action-button href="./special-ops/" label="View Special Ops" icon="🚀" />
```

External link (opens in new tab automatically):

```markdown
<action-button href="https://github.com/microsoft/agent-academy" label="Star on GitHub" icon="⭐️" />
```

**When to use:** For prominent call-to-action links on landing pages, section pages, and anywhere a styled button is preferred over a plain markdown link.

**Preview:**

![Action button component with brand styling](./assets/component-action-button.png)

---

### `<download-files />`

Bundles all files in a documentation folder into a zip and downloads it client-side using JSZip. Available as a button or an inline link.

**Props:**

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | string | — | Relative path to the folder to zip (for example `recruit/09-add-an-agent-flow/downloads`). Required. |
| `label` | string | `"Download {folder}.zip"` | Custom button/link text. |
| `variant` | `"button"` \| `"link"` | `"button"` | Render as a styled button or an inline text link. |
| `icon` | string | — | Product icon slug from `docs/.vitepress/data/icons.ts` (for example `copilot-studio`). Displays the icon inside the button. |

**Examples:**

Button variant (default):

```markdown
<download-files path="recruit/09-add-an-agent-flow/downloads" />
```

Link variant with custom label:

```markdown
<download-files path="operative/08-dataverse-grounding/downloads" label="grab the sample data" variant="link" />
```

Button with a product icon:

```markdown
<download-files path="operative/04-automate-triggers/downloads" label="Download Solution" icon="copilot-studio" />
```

**When to use:** On mission pages where learners need to download starter files, solution zips, or sample data. The `path` must point to a folder under `docs/` whose files are collected at build time by the Vite virtual module plugin.

**Preview:**

![Download files button component](./assets/component-download-files.png)

---

### `<breadcrumb />`

Renders a breadcrumb navigation trail on taxonomy pages (products, tags, industries).

**Props:**

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `section` | string | Yes | Taxonomy type: `"products"`, `"tags"`, or `"industries"`. |
| `label` | string | No | Current page label. When provided, creates a 3-level breadcrumb (Home > Section > Label). When omitted, creates a 2-level breadcrumb (Home > Section). |

**Example:**

```markdown
<breadcrumb section="tags" label="Fundamentals" />
```

**When to use:** At the top of taxonomy detail pages (for example `docs/tags/[slug].md`).

**Preview:**

![Breadcrumb navigation trail on a taxonomy page](./assets/component-breadcrumb.png)

---

### `<page-dates />`

Renders a footer showing the page's creation date and last-edited date. Reads values from frontmatter — no props are needed.

**Frontmatter fields used:**

| Field | Format | What it renders |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `created-date` | ISO date (for example `2025-08-20`) | 📅 Created: August 20, 2025 |
| `last-edited-date` | ISO date (for example `2026-03-13`) | ✏️ Last updated: March 13, 2026 |

The component renders only when at least one of these fields exists. Dates are formatted as localized strings ("Month Day, Year").

**When to use:** This component is injected automatically by the custom VitePress theme into the doc footer slot. You do not need to add it manually.

**Preview:**

![Page dates footer showing created and last updated dates](./assets/component-page-dates.png)

---

### `<products-index />`

Renders a grid of all products from `docs/.vitepress/data/products.json` with icons from `docs/public/product-icons/` and mission counts.

**Props:** None.

**Example:**

```markdown
<products-index />
```

**When to use:** On the products overview page (`docs/products/index.md`).

**Preview:**

![Products index grid with icons and mission counts](./assets/component-products-index.png)

---

### `<tags-index />`

Renders a grid of all tags from `docs/.vitepress/data/tags.json` with hardcoded SVG icons and mission counts.

**Props:** None.

**Example:**

```markdown
<tags-index />
```

**When to use:** On the tags overview page (`docs/tags/index.md`).

**Preview:**

![Tags index grid with icons and mission counts](./assets/component-tags-index.png)

---

### `<industries-index />`

Renders a grid of all industries from `docs/.vitepress/data/industries.json` with mission counts.

**Props:** None.

**Example:**

```markdown
<industries-index />
```

**When to use:** On the industries overview page (`docs/industries/index.md`).

**Preview:**

![Industries index grid with icons and mission counts](./assets/component-industries-index.png)

---

### `<preview-banner />`

Renders a warning banner marking a page as preview content. Reads the `preview` frontmatter field — no props are needed.

**When to use:** This component is injected automatically by a markdown-it plugin, directly below the page title and its `<mission-meta />` card, on any page whose frontmatter sets a truthy `preview` value. You do not need to add it manually. See [Preview banner](#preview-banner) for the frontmatter options.

---

### `<VideoLibrary />`

Renders a searchable video gallery with track filter pills and inline YouTube playback. The video list is maintained inside the component.

**Props:**

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `track` | string | `"all"` | Track selected on load. Options: `"all"`, `"recruit"`, `"operative"`, `"special-ops"`, `"cowork"`, `"agent-academy-live"`. |

**Examples:**

All videos, no pre-selected track:

```markdown
<VideoLibrary />
```

Pre-filtered to a single track:

```markdown
<VideoLibrary track="cowork" />
```

**When to use:** On the videos overview page (`docs/videos/index.md`) and on section or event pages that should surface only their own recordings.

---

### `<SessionSchedule />`

Renders the Agent Academy Live agenda as an expandable list of sessions with speaker photos, titles, and bios.

**Props:** None. Session and speaker data is hardcoded in `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/SessionSchedule.vue` — edit that file to change the agenda.

**Example:**

```markdown
<SessionSchedule />
```

**When to use:** On the live event page (`docs/events/live/index.md`).

---

### `<WorkshopsPage />`

Renders a grid of facilitator resource cards. Cards marked unavailable show a "Coming soon" label instead of a link.

**Props:** None. The resource list is hardcoded in `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/WorkshopsPage.vue`.

**Example:**

```markdown
<WorkshopsPage />
```

**When to use:** On the workshops page (`docs/events/workshops/index.md`).

---

### `<HackathonPrizes />`

Renders the hackathon prize breakdown: a participant badge row plus a per-track grid of placement badges and prizes.

**Props:** None. Tracks, placements, and badge images are hardcoded in `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/HackathonPrizes.vue`.

**Example:**

```markdown
<HackathonPrizes />
```

**When to use:** On the hackathon page (`docs/events/hackathon/index.md`).

---

## Mermaid diagrams

Mermaid diagrams are rendered client-side with theme-aware styling (dark/light mode). Use the standard fenced code block syntax:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
  Manager["Hiring Manager"]
  Agent["Hiring Agent"]
  Intake["Application Intake Agent"]

  Manager --> Agent
  Agent --> Intake

  classDef person fill:#e6f0ff,stroke:#3b82f6,color:#0b3660
  classDef agent fill:#e8f9ef,stroke:#10b981,color:#064e3b

  class Manager person
  class Agent,Intake agent
```
````

### Recommended `classDef` styles

These class definitions provide consistent styling across diagrams:

| Class | Fill | Stroke | Text color | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| `person` | `#e6f0ff` | `#3b82f6` | `#0b3660` | Humans / users |
| `agent` | `#e8f9ef` | `#10b981` | `#064e3b` | Agents / bots |
| `data` | `#f3f4f6` | `#6b7280` | `#111827` | Data stores / tables |

You can use any valid Mermaid syntax — flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, and so on.

---

## GitHub alert callouts

VitePress supports GitHub-flavored alert syntax for callout boxes. Use these to highlight tips, warnings, and important information.

### Available callout types

**NOTE** — supplementary information that adds context:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> You can have up to 10 child agents per parent agent in Copilot Studio.
```

**TIP** — best practices and recommendations:

```markdown
> [!TIP] Best Practice
> Use child agents when you need tight control over the conversation flow
> and want to reuse specific capabilities across multiple scenarios.
```

**INFO** — conceptual definitions and background context:

```markdown
> [!INFO] Learn more
> Connected agents communicate through handoffs, passing context and
> conversation history between specialized agents.
```

**WARNING** — cautions the learner should be aware of:

```markdown
> [!WARNING]
> Be careful not to create circular references when connecting agents.
```

**IMPORTANT** — critical information the learner must not miss:

```markdown
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to be part of the Frontier preview program to complete this lab.
```

### Callout titles

Adding text after the type keyword sets a custom title:

```markdown
> [!TIP] Best Practice
> Content here — the title "Best Practice" replaces the default "TIP" label.
```

When no custom title is provided, the callout uses the type keyword as the title.

---

## VitePress built-in markdown features

### Custom heading anchors

Override the auto-generated heading anchor with a custom ID using `{#id}` syntax:

```markdown
# 🎯 Mission Brief {#mission-brief}
## 🔎 Objectives {#objectives}
```

This produces `<h1 id="mission-brief">` and `<h2 id="objectives">` regardless of the emoji or text content. Use this when the heading contains emoji or special characters that would produce an ugly auto-generated anchor.

### Image sizing

Control image dimensions using attribute syntax after the image:

```markdown
![Badge image](./assets/badge.png){ width="300" }
```

This sets the rendered width to 300 pixels. Use it for badge images and other graphics that should not render at full width.

### `v-pre` container

Prevent Vue template processing inside a block. Use this when your content contains double curly braces (`{{ }}`) that should be rendered as literal text instead of being interpreted as Vue template expressions:

```markdown
::: v-pre
{{ handlebars }} syntax will render literally, not as Vue template.
:::
```

This is needed in missions that discuss template languages, Power Fx expressions, or any code containing `{{ }}`.

---

## Dark / light mode classes

Two CSS utility classes control visibility based on the current color theme:

```html
<span class="dark-only">This text only appears in dark mode</span>
<span class="light-only">This text only appears in light mode</span>
```

Use these when you need to show different images or text depending on the user's theme. For example, providing separate light-background and dark-background versions of a diagram.

---

## Preview banner

Pages that are still being developed can show a banner warning readers that the content is unfinished. The banner is injected automatically below the page title and its `<mission-meta />` card — there is no component to add to the markdown.

Set `preview: true` in the frontmatter to show the default message:

```yaml
---
preview: true
---
```

The default text depends on the page level. Course landing pages (such as `docs/recruit-v2-preview/index.md`) show:

> ⚠️ **Preview**
> This course is in preview. Content may change and some steps might not work as intended.

Mission pages (such as `docs/recruit-v2-preview/00-course-setup/index.md`) show:

> ⚠️ **Preview**
> This mission is in preview. Content may change and some steps might not work as intended.

To replace the default text, set `preview` to a string instead:

```yaml
---
preview: 'These steps target the new Copilot Studio authoring experience and may change.'
---
```

When `preview` is absent, `false`, or an empty string, nothing renders. Missions with a truthy `preview` value also show a `PREVIEW` pill on their card in `<missions />` grids.

## Taxonomy slugs

Tags, products, and industries must use slugs defined in the data files under `docs/.vitepress/data/`. Using an undefined slug will cause the pill to render without a label.
