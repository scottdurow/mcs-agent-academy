Example: By agent, Phrases, Message received. External event trigger sends a payload via connector to the agent. Example: SharePoint, Planner, email, schedule, etc. Primary use Q&amp;A, guided workflows, request-driven actions in chat - Teams, web, etc. Proactive operations and background automation - react to system changes and then notify, file, or orchestrate tasks. Trigger surface Topic triggers: By agent / Phrases / Message received / Activity types / Invoke / Inactivity / Plan complete Event triggers library via connectors; payload includes event data + optional instructions. Planner (generative orchestration) Strongly leveraged for By agent and Plan complete triggers to select/sequence topics. Required for event triggers; the agent uses instructions + payload to decide which actions/topics to call. Typical example User asks \"What's our refund policy?\" \u2192 Topic runs, queries knowledge, response. New Planner task assigned \u2192 Event trigger fires \u2192 Agent posts a Teams message, updates a record, or calls a topic. Setup path Create topics, define trigger type, author dialog/actions; publish to channels. Add event trigger (Overview \u2192 Triggers), authenticate connector with agent author credentials, configure payload/instructions; test via test pane; publish. Auth and governance Runs under channel/auth context; topic triggers respond to chat activities in allowed channels. Trigger availability depends on Power Automate data policies; connectors run under the agent maker\u2019s account. Observability Test topics within Copilot Studio, inspect conversation transcripts/activities. Use Test trigger and activity map to validate execution before publishing, monitor activity after publishing. Capacity impact Each user message/agent response is a message consuming capacity.

If this setting is disabled, only OpenAI models will be available to select.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>Allow Preview (Experimental) models to be used in Copilot Studio environments: An admin can toggle whether preview and experimental AI models are available in a given environment. If this is turned off, makers/developers will only see generally-available models (like GPT-4o) in the dropdown.</p> <p>To use GPT-5 or any future preview, the admin must turn this setting on for that specific environment.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>Move data across regions: Because experimental models may not run in the same regional data centers as standard models, enabling them often requires allowing cross-region data movement. In the Power Platform admin center (environment settings), there is a setting called Move data across regions. This must be turned on by the admin if you want to permit experimental model usage. It acknowledges that data processed by these models may leave your organization's geographic boundaries.</p> <p>For example, if your environment is in Europe and an experimental model is only hosted in US datacenters, this setting needs to be enabled to let that data flow happen. If it\u2019s disabled, Copilot won\u2019t use those models.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>These admin settings ensure that organizations stay in control of sensitive aspects like data residency and feature stability. As a developer building an agent, if you find that the option for GPT-5 preview models are missing or you see a warning about generative AI not being available, it could be that your admin has disabled experimental models or hasn\u2019t enabled cross-region data movement.

When disabled, only OpenAI models are available. Microsoft 365 Admin Center Allow Preview &amp; Experimental Models When ON, makers can choose preview/experimental AI models (for example GPT-5 Chat) for their agents. When OFF, only production-ready models are available. Power Platform admin center Move Data Across Regions Required to be ON if experimental models are enabled.

Here are the main formatting elements you can leverage in the AI\u2019s responses, and what they do:</p> Formatting Option Purpose and Effect Example Usage Bold Makes important words or phrases stand out. Use bold to highlight key information or critical values. \"Your account balance is $1,250.\" - The amount is bold so it's immediately noticeable. Italics Adds subtle emphasis or denotes special terms. Commonly used for document titles, or to highlight a phrase in a softer way than bold. \"Please provide additional details for verification.\" - The words \u201cadditional details\u201d are italicized to indicate a prompt or placeholder. Hyperlinks Inserts clickable links in the response text. Useful for directing users to external articles, internal knowledge base, or any detailed reference. \"Refer to our Microsoft Surface Warranty and Protection Plans for more details.\" - The text \"Microsoft Surface Warranty and Protection Plans\" is a hyperlink to the web page. Power Fx expressions Embeds dynamic content or logic-driven text in the response. Power Fx can pull in variables, do calculations, or enforce formatting (even with regex for validation). This allows parts of the answer to be determined by real-time data or conditions. \"Today is <code>${Text(Now(), \"dddd, mmmm d, yyyy\")}</code>.\" - This uses a Power Fx formula to insert the current date in a long format, <code>Friday, October 3, 2025</code>. You could also use expressions to format numbers, or ensure an output meets a pattern (using regex). <p>Tip</p> <p>Always test your response formatting using the testing pane in Copilot Studio. Try out sample user questions. See if the agent\u2019s answer is coming through with the formatting you expect. If something is not right, such as the response shows markdown syntax in text instead of formatting it, you may need to adjust the instructions. Sometimes the model might not be sure it\u2019s allowed to use formatting and will \u201cplay safe\u201d by showing the markdown syntax such as raw asterisks. Clarify in the formatting instructions and repeat testing till you're satisfied.</p>"},{"location":"operative-preview/05-model-selection/#best-practices-for-formatting-responses","title":"\u2b50 Best practices for formatting responses","text":"<p>Now that we know what we can do, let\u2019s talk about what we should do to make the AI\u2019s answers clear and effective. Here are some best practices, aimed at developers crafting the agent\u2019s behavior:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Be consistent with style: Establish a consistent format for similar types of responses.</p> <p>For example, you might provide the following instructions: <code>Term in bold, followed by a colon, then the definition in regular text.</code></p> <p>Do that every time for a definition.</p> <p>Or if the agent is listing multiple options, always use a bulleted list rather than sometimes bullets, sometimes a paragraph.</p> <p>Consistency helps users quickly understand the structure of the answer. You can enforce this by specifying it in instructions: <code>\"Always answer with bullet points when listing options.\"</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Use emphasis sparingly but meaningfully: Apply bold to the most crucial information only - typically one or two words or a short phrase that the user should not miss. Avoid bolding entire paragraphs or large chunks, as that defeats the purpose.</p> <p>Use italics for secondary emphasis or to denote something like an example input or a note. For instance, italicizing error messages or user-provided text can differentiate it from the rest of the agent\u2019s output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leverage lists for structure: When an answer contains multiple pieces of information or a step-by-step process, don\u2019t bury it in a sentence. If it\u2019s naturally a sequence, use a numbered list (1, 2, 3, \u2026). If it\u2019s an unordered collection, like features of a product, use bullet points.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mind the tone along with format: The formatting should complement the agent\u2019s tone. If your agent\u2019s persona is very formal, you might avoid using exclamation marks or casual emphasis. If it\u2019s friendly, maybe an occasional bold \u201cGreat choice!\u201d is fine. The tone is primarily set by language, but formatting can amplify it. A friendly chatty agent might even use emoticons or emojis (if appropriate) - though use those sparingly and only if they fit the use case.</p> </li> <li> <p>Check hyperlink texts: When including hyperlinks in answers, make sure the link text is descriptive of what it leads to. This not only looks more professional but also aids accessibility.</p> <p>For example, <code>\"download the report here\"</code> is not as good as <code>\"download the Quarterly Report\"</code> where \"Quarterly Report\" is the hyperlink. Ensure the URLs are correct and the user has permission to access them if they are internal sites.</p> </li> <li> <p>Utilize Power Fx for dynamic formatting: A powerful aspect for developers is that you can combine the generative answer with Power Fx expressions to refine the output.</p> <p>For instance, suppose the initial response is <code>\"Your order total is 1250 usd.\u201d</code> You could use a Power Fx formula to format that number as US currency and replace <code>\"usd\"</code> with the dollar symbol, resulting in <code>\"$1,250.00\"</code>.</p> <p>You might do this with a formula like: <code>\"$\" &amp; Text(ThisItem.OrderTotal, \"[$-en-US]#,##0.00\")</code></p> <p>This formula ensures the number is formatted with commas and two decimal places, following US conventions.</p> <p>Similarly, if generative AI provides a date in an undesirable format, a Power Fx expression could re-format it. Essentially, you can post-process the AI\u2019s text to enforce any strict patterns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Validate and extract text using regex: TBC</p> </li> <li> <p>Aim for readability: After applying all the above, always put yourself in the user\u2019s perspective and read the output. Is it easy to find the main point? Is the response unnecessarily long? Often, less is more. If the AI tends to be very verbose, consider instructing it to be concise or limiting the scope of answers.</p> <p>On the other hand, if the answer is too short or lacks detail, you might want to add instructions asking for more explanation or examples.</p> <p>The format can only do so much - the content quality must be there. A good balance is a short answer that addresses the query, followed by a hyperlink or an option to get more info. For instance, <code>\"Your password was reset successfully. You will receive a confirmation email shortly. If you did not request this, please head to [https://support.example.com](https://support.microsoft.com).\"</code> - This is clear, and the additional info (contact support) is given via a hyperlink rather than a big paragraph about what to do.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In summary, use formatting to enhance clarity, not distract. The user should be able to glance at the agent\u2019s answer and grasp the needed information quickly.

This gives an at-a-glance ratio of positive to negative feedback.

This typically lets you filter feedback by type (all/thumbs-up/thumbs-down) and view the list of user comments associated with each feedback. Comments are extremely useful - a thumbs-down by itself signals a problem, but the user's comment might explain why <code>\"The answer was incorrect\"</code> or <code>\"Didn't address my question\"</code> etc.</li> <li>Trend Over Time: The analytics can be viewed for different date ranges (last 7 days, 30 days, etc., up to 90 days). Monitoring trends helps see if recent changes to the agent improved satisfaction - for example, an increase in thumbs-up percentage after adding a new knowledge source.</li> <li>Session CSAT vs Per-Response Reactions: The Satisfaction analytics also include a Survey results section for end-of-session customer satisfaction (CSAT) surveys. Don't confuse this with the per-response thumbs reactions:<ul> <li>Reactions: feedback on individual answers (our focus here)</li> <li>Survey Results: an optional overall rating at the end of a conversation (a 1-5 star survey).

We covered adaptive cards previously in Recruit. As a reminder: Adaptive Cards are essentially UI panels defined in JSON that you can embed in an agent's conversation to collect input or display information. In this context, you design a card that asks the user for feedback - for example, <code>\"Please rate this answer\"</code> with an Input.ChoiceSet element that displays a dropdown or radio buttons of feedback values for the user to select from, and the user's response is sent back to the agent as structured data.</p> <p>Unlike the built-in reactions, this method requires the developer or maker to configure the agent's topics to insert the card and handle the responses. Copilot Studio allows adding an Adaptive Card in the following nodes within a topic:</p> <ul> <li>Ask a question</li> <li>Ask with adaptive card</li> <li>Send a message</li> </ul> <p>This means after the agent generates an answer, you can immediately follow up with a custom adaptive card asking for feedback before the conversation continues.</p>"},{"location":"operative-preview/11-obtain-user-feedback/#how-it-works","title":"How it works","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Generate the answer and store it: First, ensure you have the agent's answer available to include in the card. For example, the Copilot Studio guidance suggests using a Generative Answers node to produce the answer and save it to a variable (example: <code>Global.VarStoreAnswer</code>). This variable can hold the AI's response text.</p> </li> <li> <p>Show Adaptive Card with feedback options: Immediately after the answer, add a node that supports Adaptive Cards to display the answer text and ask for feedback. The adaptive card's JSON defines what the user sees - the answer text, a prompt like <code>\"Was this answer helpful?\"</code>, and two action buttons (perhaps one for \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb \"Useful\" and one for \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb \"Not useful\"). You could also design other input types, like a 5-star rating, a text box for comments, or multiple-choice options. Adaptive Cards are very flexible, so you can tailor the feedback question format to your needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>User selects an Option: When the user clicks a button or submits the card, that action returns a payload to the agent. Typically, the card's buttons use <code>Action.Submit</code> with some custom data. For instance, one button might return a value <code>{ \"Feedback\": \"Useful\" }</code> and the other returns <code>{ \"Feedback\": \"NotUseful\" }</code>. In the example provided by Microsoft, the card's JSON has <code>selectAction</code> data set to a string like <code>\"This generated answer was useful\"</code> or <code>\"wasn't useful\"</code> for the two icons. This data comes back as the user's response.</p> </li> <li> <p>Agent handles the feedback data: Now it's up to your agent's logic to do something with that feedback. This can be achieved using a topic or trigger to catch the submitted response. For example, you might configure the conversation such that if the user's input (from the adaptive card) equals \"This generated answer wasn't useful\", it triggers a particular topic - perhaps asking an additional question like <code>\"Sorry to hear that. Could you tell me what was wrong?\"</code>. Or more simply, you might just log it in a datasource and acknowledge <code>\"Thanks for your feedback!\"</code> without further interaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Store or forward the feedback: The feedback collected via Adaptive Card is not automatically saved to the Analytics like the built-in reactions. If you want to persist this data for analysis, you should explicitly store it. For example, you could call a Power Automate flow or an API to record the feedback in a database or SharePoint list, including context like which question it was for. Alternatively, since the feedback appears as part of the conversation transcript (the user's selection is essentially a message from the user), it will be saved in Dataverse conversations. But it will be in a raw text/JSON form, you'd have to extract it for reporting.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Best Practice</p> <p>Adaptive Cards in Copilot Studio are supported in all channels that the agent supports, but be mindful of Adaptive Card schema version differences. Copilot Studio uses Adaptive Cards v1.6 in the web test chat, but Microsoft Teams and some other channels support up to v1.5. In practice, this means if you design your card with features only in 1.6, it might not render in Microsoft Teams. Best practice is to stick to v1.5 features for broad compatibility, or test your card in each channel. The good news is the typical feedback card (text, buttons) is basic and works fine in all channels.</p>"},{"location":"operative-preview/11-obtain-user-feedback/#why-use-adaptive-cards-for-feedback","title":"\ud83e\udd9c Why use Adaptive Cards for feedback","text":"<p>Using an Adaptive Card for feedback requires additional effort to set up, but it offers greater flexibility and control. Some reasons you might choose this approach:</p> <ul> <li>Custom questions and UI: You're not limited to a simple thumbs up/down. You could ask the user to rate on a scale of 1 - 5, choose a category for why they liked/disliked the answer, give them a range of answers to select (multiple-choice) or even ask an open-ended question for detailed comments. You design the card's content to suit your scenario.</li> <li>Contextual or conditional feedback: You might not want to request feedback after every single response (to avoid annoying the user). With your own logic, you could decide to ask only after certain types of answers - for example, only after a long explanation, or only if the session is about to end. You could also tailor the wording: if the answer was an error message, the card could specifically ask, <code>\"Sorry I couldn't help - was this error explanation useful?\"</code> This level of nuance is not possible with the generic thumbs UI.</li> <li>Integrated workflows: With custom feedback data, you can integrate directly into other processes. For example, if a user indicates an answer was not useful, you could automatically create a ticket for a human expert to review that query later. Or log the feedback to an Azure Application Insights telemetry for advanced analytics. Essentially, adaptive card feedback can plug into your own analytics or DevOps cycle more readily. The built-in thumbs data is somewhat siloed in the Copilot analytics dashboard, whereas custom-collected data is yours to route anywhere.</li> <li>Branding and tone: You can format the feedback card to match your agent's personality or your organization's branding (within the Adaptive Card design limits). Even the text can be changed - for example, <code>\"Rate this response\"</code> or using emoji on buttons  giving a consistent user experience.</li> <li>Additional feedback gathering: The card could ask for more than just a sentiment. For instance, a single card could both ask <code>\"Was this helpful? (Yes/No)\"</code> and if <code>\"No\"</code>, also include a quick text box saying <code>\"What was missing?\"</code>. All that could be submitted together. This is more advanced but illustrates the flexibility.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, Adaptive Cards for feedback are ideal when you need more than a binary signal or want to handle the feedback in custom ways. It's often used by developers who want to experiment with feedback collection beyond the basics.</p>"},{"location":"operative-preview/11-obtain-user-feedback/#best-practices-for-adaptive-card-feedback","title":"\u2b50 Best practices for Adaptive Card feedback","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Keep it brief and unobtrusive: Users may get annoyed if after every message they have to fill out a survey. Make the card simple - usually a quick question with two buttons or a small rating scale. The example in Microsoft's guidance shows the agent's answer in the card followed by a subtle prompt <code>\"Generated answer, please rate it.\"</code>. The prompt is small and polite, which is good. Avoid very large or complex cards for routine feedback.</p> </li> <li> <p>Handle the response gracefully: When the user clicks feedback, you might simply thank them silently (no need to always say <code>\"Thanks for your feedback\"</code> every time). In a support scenario, if someone says the answer wasn't useful, you might follow up to help: <code>\"Sorry about that. Let me clarify or escalate your question.\"</code> This turns a negative feedback into an opportunity to recover the user's satisfaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Handling and Privacy: The feedback data from the adaptive card is just part of the conversation in terms of storage. It will not show up in the Copilot Studio Analytics dashboard (since that only tracks the built-in feedback reaction mechanism). It also won't automatically appear in any compliance audits (those typically log that a user message was sent, but not the content of an Adaptive Card submission specifically). So, if analyzing this feedback is important, plan to capture it. You can create an agent flow triggered by the conversation to write each feedback entry to a separate Dataverse table or external storage along with relevant info (user ID, question asked, etc.). This way you can do your own reporting on it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable built-in reactions to avoid duplication: If you are fully relying on a custom feedback card for every answer, it might be wise to turn off the default thumbs feedback in the agent settings. Otherwise, users will see two feedback requests (the thumbs UI and your adaptive card) for the same response, which is confusing and overkill. Most implementations choose either one method or the other in production. However, you could still use both in different contexts - for example, maybe you keep thumbs enabled for Teams users, but on a custom website you use a tailored card. In any case, ensure the user isn't bombarded with redundant feedback prompts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test on all channels: Because Adaptive Cards can render a bit differently in Teams vs. web chat, test your feedback cycle in each deployed channel. Make sure the card looks as intended and the submission is received by the agent. For instance, if using Teams, ensure the card's schema is less than or equal to 1.5 as noted earlier. Also verify that on mobile versions of Teams or web chat, the adaptive card is still easily usable.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In the Copilot Studio documentation example, once the adaptive card feedback was set up, they provided a YAML snippet indicating how the agent can route the \"useful/not useful\" responses to a specific handling topic. This is a hint at the implementation: essentially treat the feedback like an intent that triggers either a follow-up or just completes. Implementing this means editing your agent's topics (or code) to catch those JSON responses.</p>"},{"location":"operative-preview/11-obtain-user-feedback/#comparison-summary-thumbs-reactions-vs-adaptive-card-feedback","title":"\ud83e\uddc7 Comparison summary: thumbs reactions vs Adaptive Card feedback","text":"<p>Both feedback collection methods aim to improve your Copilot agent via user input, but they serve different needs. Here's a side-by-side comparison to help understand when to use each:</p> Feature/aspect Built-in thumbs up/down reactions Custom feedback via Adaptive Card Setup and effort Zero setup required - enabled by default for all agents. Simply deploy your agent, and users will see \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb/\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb on each response. Requires configuration: you must add an Adaptive Card node to your topics and define its JSON, then handle the submitted data. Moderate effort for developers. Feedback format Binary sentiment (Positive or Negative). Users can optionally add a text comment with their rating Fully customizable. Could be binary as well, or multi-choice, rating scale, text input, or any combination. The card's JSON defines the format User experience Simple and unobtrusive: one click for thumbs up/down. The option is presented uniformly on all channels (icon buttons). Potential for richer interaction, but if overused can be intrusive. You control the wording and look. Make sure the card is concise so it doesn't overwhelm the chat UI Data captured Reaction (+ optional comment). Example: <code>\"thumbs down (with comment: 'irrelevant answer')\"</code>. No structured category beyond up/down. Whatever data you design. Example: you might capture <code>\"Rating: 3 stars\"</code> or <code>\"FeedbackChoice: NotUseful + Reason: Outdated info\"</code>. The card submission is received as a JSON payload (key-value pairs) which you can parse Analytics and visibility Automatically aggregated in Copilot Studio Analytics in Satisfaction section. Shows total count of \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb vs \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb, and allows filtering/viewing comments Not shown in Copilot Studio Analytics by default. These responses are essentially part of the conversation flow (stored in transcripts) and do not feed the out-of-box dashboards. You need to create your own reporting mechanism if you want to summarize this feedback. Extensibility Limited (thumbs UI is fixed). Can't change the question or add more options to built-in mechanism. You can turn it off or on, that's it. Extensible. You craft the adaptive card and can evolve it. Example: adding a third option <code>\"Partially helpful\"</code>, or asking a follow-up question if they respond negatively. Also, you decide when to invoke it (doesn't have to be every turn). Ideal use cases General satisfaction monitoring for your agent's answers. Best when you want a quick gauge of every response's quality and a simple success metric to track over time. Great for initial deployments to gather broad feedback with minimal effort. Deep feedback or custom workflows. Useful when specific insights are needed, Example: which of several answers is better, or when integrating feedback into other systems (like creating bug reports, triggering human review). Also valuable if you want to collect feedback in a specific format such as category tags that the built-in reactions mechanism doesn't support. <p>As a rule of thumb (no pun intended \ud83d\ude06), start with the built-in thumbs feedback for any new agent - it's easy and provides immediate value in understanding user satisfaction. As your solution matures, if you find the need for more nuanced feedback, you can experiment with an Adaptive Card approach.</p> <p>Some advanced implementations even use both: for example, keeping thumbs up/down enabled, but also asking a targeted question via an adaptive card at the end of a session (like a mini survey). In that case, you'd get per-response sentiment (via reactions) and an overall session rating or comment (via your card).

This \u201cworld knowledge\u201d lets them respond on many topics.  </li> <li>Tokenization: Text is broken into smaller units called tokens (words, subwords, or characters).

Solutions are essential for Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), they enable you to manage your app and agents from idea to development, testing, deployment, and updates.</p> <p>In Copilot Studio, every agent you create is stored in a Power Platform solution. By default, agents are created in the Default solution, unless you create a new custom solution to create your agent in. This is what we'll learn \ud83e\udd13 in this lesson and in the hands-on lab.</p> <p>Solutions traditionally have been created in the Power Apps maker portal - a web based interface where you can build and customize apps, Dataverse, flows, explore AI components and more.</p> <p></p> <p>In Copilot Studio, there is now the Solution Explorer where you can manage your solutions directly. You no longer need to switch to the Power Apps maker portal to manage your solutions, it can be done right inside Copilot Studio \ud83e\ude84</p> <p>This means you can do the usual solution-related tasks:</p> <ul> <li>Create a solution - custom solutions enable agents to be exported and imported between environments.</li> <li>Set your preferred solution - choose the solution agents, apps, etc will be created in by default.</li> <li>Add or remove components - your agent could be referencing other components such as environment variables or cloud flows. Therefore these components needed to be included in the solution.</li> <li>Export solutions - to move solutions to another target environment.</li> <li>Import solutions - import solutions created elsewhere, including upgrading or updating solutions.</li> <li>Create and manage solution pipelines - automate the deployment of solutions between environments.</li> <li>Git integration - enables developers to connect solutions with Git repositories for version control, collaboration and ALM. Intended to be used in developer environments only.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>There are two types of solutions:</p> <ul> <li>Unmanaged solutions - used during development. You can freely edit and customize as needed.</li> <li>Managed solutions - used when you're ready to deploy your app to testing or production.

Copilot next asks us to refine the instructions. It's asking how we should respond to particular issues and we'll request that it acknowledges the issue, provide examples of topics to answer, and format the response as bullet points.</p> <p>Copy and paste the following, and submit the request to Copilot.</p> <pre><code>Prioritize urgent requests. Examples of IT issues or scenarios to help with: device problems, network connectivity, log in issues. When troubleshooting, first acknowledge their issue and respond with empathy, then provide step by step guidance using bullet points and ask if they require further assistance.\n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The instructions of the agent will be updated after Copilot has received the request. Notice how on the right hand side pane, that starter prompts have now appeared. These were formed based on our instructions.</p> <p>Next, Copilot is asking for public websites to ground the agent's knowledge.</p> <p>Copy and paste the following, and submit the request to Copilot.</p> <pre><code>https://support.microsoft.com\n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The public website will be added as a knowledge source. Copilot is asking if additional knowledge sources are to be added. We don't need to add additional public websites.</p> <p>Copy and paste the following, and submit the request to Copilot.</p> <pre><code>Proceed with setup\n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Copilot confirms the setup of our Contoso Helpdesk Agent is complete but we'll add one more modification, we're going to request that our agent does not answer HR related questions. This lets our agent know that it should not answer HR related questions asked by users.</p> <p>Copy and paste the following, and submit the request to Copilot.</p> <pre><code>Do not provide assistance to questions related to HR, examples are: What is my vacation leave balance? How many sick days do I have? What's the URL to our payroll portal? \n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The instructions will be updated to not provide assistance with questions related to HR. We don't need to make further updates, our agent is ready to be created.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Before we create our agent, let's do a couple of things.</p> <p>First, select the Configure tab to view the agent details defined from our conversation with Copilot. This is where you'll see the Name, Description, Instructions, Knowledge and Suggested/Starter prompts.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Secondly, let's test our agent. Copy and paste the following, and submit the question to our agent.</p> <pre><code>How can I check the warranty status of my Surface?\n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The response to the question will then display where the answers are in the format of a step-by-step guide using bullet points. Great, our agent works! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Lastly, we'll double check the solution that our agent will be created in, is the solution we created and selected as the preferred solution in Lesson 04 - Create a new solution.</p> <p>Select the ellipsis icon (...) and select Update Advanced Settings.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The Advanced Settings modal will appear and we can see our solution created from earlier is selected by default. This is due to selecting our solution as the preferred solution in Lesson 04 - Create a new solution.</p> <p>Select Cancel.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Let's now create our custom agent! Select Create.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Copilot Studio will begin provisioning our agent.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Once our agent has been provisioned, we can see the details of the agent reflect what we requested during our Copilot conversational creation experience. Scroll down to review the agent where you'll see the name, description, instructions, the knowledge sources and the suggested prompts. The orchestration mode is enabled by default and the default model is used for the response model of the agent.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Let's now test our newly created agent. In the Test pane on the right hand side, select the Activity Map icon.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Enter the following question in the Test pane.</p> <pre><code>How do I find my Windows 11 product key?\n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The Activity map will then load which shows us in real-time what path the agent is processing. In this scenario, our agent has understood the question and searches the knowledge sources. Currently we have one source which is the public website we added earlier using Copilot, which is what the agent is reviewing.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Our agent then responds with answers that are outlined as bullet points, as defined in the instructions. The response has references to the web pages that the agent formed its response from. This enables users to verify the source of the answer.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>You can also review the response and its sources by scrolling down the Knowledge modal in the Activity map.</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>Congratulations!

You can perform an operation on data to transform it into a desired output. When building your formula in Excel you select your input value from the cells in a table or a range, and then apply functions to manipulate the data output. An example is using the <code>COUNT</code> function to work out the number of cells that contain numbers from a range.</p> <p>In agent flows, instead of referencing data from cells in a table, you're referencing data outputs from the trigger or actions when building your expressions. Continuing with the previous example, use the function <code>length</code> to retrieve the number of items returned from the Get items SharePoint connector action.</p>"},{"location":"recruit/09-add-an-agent-flow/#why-do-functions-matter","title":"Why do functions matter?","text":"<p>Using functions makes your agent flows:</p> <ul> <li>Smarter - they can react to different inputs or conditions.</li> <li>Flexible - you can customize how data is handled.</li> <li>Efficient - you avoid manual steps by automating logic.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recruit/09-add-an-agent-flow/#most-useful-functions","title":"Most useful functions","text":"<p>The following are common functions used in agent flows.
