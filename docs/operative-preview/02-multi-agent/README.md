# üö® Mission 02: Connected Agents

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CODENAME: `OPERATION SYMPHONY`

> **‚è±Ô∏è Operation Time Window:** `~45 minutes`

## üéØ Mission Brief

Welcome back, Agent. In Mission 01, you built your main Hiring Agent - a solid foundation for managing recruitment workflows. But one agent can only do so much.

This mission transforms your single agent into a **multi-agent system**: an orchestrated team of specialized agents that work together to handle complex hiring challenges. Think of it as upgrading from a solo operator to commanding a specialized task force.

You'll add two critical specialists to your existing Hiring Agent: an Application Intake Agent to process resumes automatically, and an Interview Prep Agent to create comprehensive interview materials. These agents will work together seamlessly under your main orchestrator.

Welcome to the world of connected intelligence.

## üîé Objectives

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. The difference between **child agents** and **connected agents** and when to use each
1. How to design **multi-agent architectures** that scale and collaborate effectively  
1. Creating specialized **child agents** for focused tasks within your existing Hiring Agent
1. Establishing **communication patterns** between your main agent and specialist agents
1. Adding the Application Intake Agent and Interview Prep Agent to your hiring system

## ü§îWhat Are Connected Agents?

In Copilot Studio, you're not limited to building single, monolithic agents. You can create **multi-agent systems** - networks of specialized agents that work together to handle complex workflows.

Think of it like a real-world organization: instead of one person doing everything, you have specialists who excel at specific tasks and collaborate when needed.

### Why Multi-Agent Systems Matter

- **Scalability:** Each agent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently by different teams.  
- **Specialization:** Agents can focus on what they do best. Perhaps one for data processing, another for user interaction, another for decision-making.  
- **Flexibility:** You can mix and match agents, reuse them across projects, and evolve your system incrementally.  
- **Maintainability:** Changes to one agent don't necessarily affect others, making updates safer and easier.

### Real-World Example: Hiring Process

Consider our hiring workflow, multiple agents might work together with the following responsibilities:

- **Resume intake** requires document parsing and data extraction skills
- **Scoring** involves evaluating candidate resumes and matching them to job requirements
- **Interview preparation** needs deep reasoning about candidate fit  
- **Candidate communication** requires empathetic, communication abilities

Rather than building one massive agent that tries to handle all these different skills, you can create specialized agents for each area and orchestrate them together.

## üîó Child Agents vs Connected Agents: The Key Difference

Copilot Studio offers two ways to build multi-agent systems, each with distinct use cases:

### ‚ÜòÔ∏è Child Agents

Child agents are **lightweight specialists** that live within your main agent. Think of them as specialized teams within the same department.

#### Key Technical Details

- Child agents are contained within the parent agent, and have a single configuration page.
- Tools and Knowledge are **stored at the parent** agent, but configured to be "Available to" the child agent.
- Child agents **share the topics** of their parent agent. Topics can be referenced by the child agent instructions.
- Child agents **do not need to be published** separately - they are automatically available within their parent agent once created. This does make testing easier because changes to the parent and child agents can be performed in the **same shared workspace**.

#### Use child agents when

- A single team manages the entire solution
- You want to logically organize tools and knowledge into sub-agents
- You don't need separate authentication or deployment for each agent
- The agents won't be published separately or used independently
- You don't need to reuse agents across multiple solutions

**Example:** An IT helpdesk agent with child agents for:

- Password reset procedures
- Hardware troubleshooting  
- Software installation guides

### üîÄ Connected Agents

Connected agents are **full-fledged, independent agents** that your main agent can collaborate with. Think of them as separate departments working together on a project.

#### Key Technical Details

- Connected agents have **their own topics** and conversation flows. They operate independently with their own settings, logic, and deployment lifecycle.
- Connected agents **must be published** before they can be added to and used by other agents.
- During testing, changes to the connected agent must be published before they can be used by the calling agent.

#### Use connected agents when

- Multiple teams develop and maintain different agents independently
- Agents need their own settings, authentication, and deployment channels
- You want to publish and maintain agents separately with independent application lifecycle management (ALM) for each agent
- Agents should be reusable across multiple solutions

**Example:** A customer service system that connects to:

- A separate billing agent maintained by the finance team
- A separate technical support agent maintained by the product team
- A separate returns agent maintained by the operations team

!!! tip "Tip"
    You can mix both approaches! For example, your main agent could connect to external agents from other teams while also having its own child agents for specialized internal tasks.

## üéØMulti-Agent Architecture Patterns

When designing multi-agent systems, several patterns emerge based on how agents interact:

| Pattern              | Description                                                                 | Best For                                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hub and Spoke**    | A main orchestrator agent coordinates with multiple specialized agents. The orchestrator handles user interaction and delegates tasks to child or connected agents. | Complex workflows where one agent coordinates specialized tasks |
| **Pipeline**         | Agents pass work sequentially from one to the next, each adding value before passing to the next stage. | Linear processes like application processing (intake ‚Üí screening ‚Üí interview ‚Üí decision) |
| **Collaborative**    | Agents work together simultaneously on different aspects of the same problem, sharing context and results. | Complex analysis requiring multiple perspectives or expertise areas |

!!! tip "Tip"
    You may even have a hybrid of two or more of these patterns.

## üí¨Agent Communication and Context Sharing

When agents work together, they need to share information effectively. Here's how this works in Copilot Studio:

### Conversation History

By default, when a main agent calls a child or connected agent, it can pass along the **conversation history**. This gives the specialist agent full context about what the user has been discussing.

You can disable this for security or performance reasons - for example, if the specialist agent only needs to complete a specific task without needing the full conversation context. This can be a good defense against **data leakage**.

### Explicit Instructions

Your main agent can give **specific instructions** to child or connected agents. For example: "Process this resume and summarize their skills for the Senior Developer role."

### Return Values

Agents can return structured information back to the calling agent, allowing the main agent to use that information in subsequent steps or share it with other agents.

### Dataverse Integration

For more complex scenarios, agents can share information through **Dataverse** or other data stores, allowing for persistent context sharing across multiple interactions.

## ‚ÜòÔ∏èChild Agent: Application Intake Agent

Let's start building our multi-agent hiring system. Our first specialist will be the **Application Intake Agent** - a child agent responsible for processing incoming resumes and candidate information.

### ü§ùApplication Intake Agent Responsibilities

- **Parse resume content** from PDFs provided via interactive chat (In a future mission you will learn how to process resumes autonomously).
- **Extract structured data** (name, skills, experience, education)
- **Match candidates to open roles** based on qualifications and cover letter
- **Store candidate information** in Dataverse for later processing
- **Deduplicate applications** to avoid creating the same Candidate twice, match to existing records using the email address extracted from the Resume.

### ‚≠êWhy This Should Be a Child Agent

The Application Intake Agent fits perfectly as a child agent because:

- It's specialized for document processing and data extraction
- It doesn't need to be published separately  
- It's part of our overall hiring solution managed by the same team
- It focuses on a specific trigger (new resume received) and is invoked from the Hiring Agent.

## üîÄConnected Agent: Interview Prep Agent  

Our second specialist will be the **Interview Prep Agent** - a connected agent that helps create comprehensive interview materials and evaluates candidate responses.

### ü§ùInterview Prep Agent Responsibilities

- **Create interview packs** with company information, role requirements, and evaluation criteria
- **Generate interview questions** tailored to specific roles and candidate backgrounds
- **Answer general questions** about the Job Roles and Applications for stakeholder communication

### ‚≠êWhy This Should Be a Connected Agent

The Interview Prep Agent works better as a connected agent because:

- The talent acquisition team might want to use it independently across multiple hiring processes
- It needs its own knowledge base of interview best practices and evaluation criteria
- Different hiring managers might want to customize its behavior for their teams
- It could be reused for internal positions, not just external hiring

## üß™Lab 2.1: Adding the Application Intake Agent

Ready to put theory into practice? Let's add our first child agent to your existing Hiring Agent.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Your **Hiring Agent** from Mission 01 open in Copilot Studio
- Access to the Dataverse environment with candidate storage tables
- Sample resume files for testing

!!! note "Building on Mission 01"
    This mission builds directly on the Hiring Agent you created in Mission 01. If you haven't completed that mission or need to start fresh, you can import the Mission 02 starter solution which includes the base Hiring Agent and required Dataverse tables.

1. Inside Copilot Studio, Select the ellipsis (...) below Tools in the left hand navigation.
1. Select **Solutions**.
1. Locate your Operative solution, select the ellipsis (...) next to it, and choose **Set preferred solution**. This will ensure that all your work will be added to this solution.

### 1. Open Your Existing Hiring Agent

1. **Navigate** to Copilot Studio. Ensure your environment is selected in the top right Environment Picker.

1. Open your **Hiring Agent** from Mission 01

1. Select **Edit** in the **Instructions** section of the Overview tab, and add the following instructions to the top:

    ```text
    You are the central orchestrator for the hiring process. You coordinate activities, provide summaries, and delegate work to specialized agents.
    ```

1. Select **Save**

1. Select **Settings** (top right)

1. Ensure the following settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | Use generative AI orchestration for your agent's responses | **Yes** |
    | Content Moderation | **Moderate** |
    | Use general knowledge | **Off** |
    | Use information from the Web | **Off** |
    | File uploads | **On** |

### 2. Add the Application Intake Child Agent

1. **Navigate** to the **Agents** tab within your Hiring Agent - this is where you'll add specialist agents.

1. Select **+ Add** and then **Create and agent**. Note that this is labeled with "*Create a lightweight agent that lives inside your current agent and inherits its settings. Ideal for breaking down complex logic* "

1. **Name** your agent `Application Intake Agent`

1. Select **The agent chooses** - Based on description in the **When will this be used?** dropdown. These options are similar to the triggers that can be configured for topics.

1. Set the **Description** to be :

    ```text
    Processes incoming resumes and stores candidates in the system
    ```

1. Ensure that the toggle **Web Search** is set to **Disabled**. This is because we only want to used information provided by the parent agent.

### 3. Add Tools and Connections

Agents cannot perform any actions without being given Tools or Topics.

We are using **Agent Flow tools** rather than Topics for the *Upload Resume* and *Upsert Candidate* steps because these are complex, multi-step backend processes that require deterministic execution and integration with external systems. While Topics are best for guiding the conversational dialog, Agent Flows provide the structured automation needed to reliably handle file processing, data validation, and database upserts (insert new or update existing) without depending on user interaction.

1. Locate the **Tools** section inside the Application Intake Agent page.
   **Important:** This is not the Tools tab of the parent agent, but can be found if you scroll down underneath the child agent instructions.

1. Select **+ Add** - > Select **+ New tool** ‚Üí Select **Agent flow**.
   The Agent Flow designer will open, this is where we will add the upload resume logic.

1. Select the **When an agent calls the flow** node, and select **+ Add** an input for the following Parameters, being sure to add both the name and the description.

    | Type  | Name     | Description                                                                                                   |
    |-------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | File  | Resume   | The Resume PDF file                                                                                           |
    | Text  | Message  | Extract a cover letter style message from the context. The message must be less than 2000 characters.         |

   ```text
   You are tasked with managing incoming Resumes, Candidate information, and creating Job Applications.  
   Only use tools if the step exactly matches the defined process. Otherwise, indicate you cannot help.  
   
   Process for Resume Upload via Chat  
   1. Upload Resume  
      - Trigger only if /System.Activity.Attachments contains exactly one new resume.  
      - If more than one file, instruct the user to upload one at a time and stop.  
      - Call /Upload Resume once. Never upload more than once for the same message.  
   
   2. Post-Upload  
      - Always output the [ResumeNumber] (R#####).  
   ```
