--8<-- "disclaimer.md"

## 🕵️‍♂️ CODENAME: `DOCUMENT RESUME RECON`

> **⏱️ Operation Time Window:** `~45 minutes`

## 🎯 Mission Brief

Welcome, Operative. Your previous missions have equipped you with powerful agent orchestration skills, but now it's time to unlock a game-changing capability: **multimodal document analysis**.

Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is **Document Resume Recon** - mastering the art of extracting structured intelligence from any document with surgical precision. While your agents can process text with ease, the real world throws PDFs, images, and complex documents at you daily. Resumes pile up, invoices need processing, and forms require instant digitization.

This mission will transform you from a text-only operative into a **multimodal intelligence expert**. You'll learn to configure AI that sees, reads, and understands documents like a human analyst - but with the speed that only AI can deliver. By mission's end, you'll have built a complete resume extraction system that seamlessly integrates with your hiring workflow.

The intelligence you gather here will be critical for the advanced data grounding operations in your next mission.

## 🔎 Objectives

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. What multimodal prompts are and when to use different AI models
1. How to configure prompts with image and document inputs
1. How to format prompt outputs as JSON for structured data extraction
1. Best practices for prompt engineering with document analysis
1. How to integrate multimodal prompts with Agent Flows

## 🧠 Understanding multimodal prompts

### What makes a prompt "multimodal"?

Here's the intelligence briefing: traditional prompts are text-only operatives. But multimodal prompts? They're elite agents capable of processing multiple types of intel:

- **Text**: Written instructions and content
- **Images**: Photos, screenshots, charts, and diagrams (.PNG, .JPG, .JPEG)  
- **Documents**: Invoices, resumes, forms (.PDF)

This capability opens up powerful scenarios like analyzing resumes, processing invoices, or extracting data from forms.

### Why multimodal matters for your operations

Every day, your organization faces these intelligence challenges:

- **Resume screening**: Manually reading hundreds of resumes burns through valuable hours
- **Invoice processing**: Extracting vendor details, amounts, and dates from unpredictable document structures
- **Form analysis**: Converting paper forms into actionable digital intelligence

Multimodal prompts eliminate these bottlenecks by combining AI's language understanding with advanced visual analysis capabilities. Think of it as giving your AI agent superhuman sight.

### Common business scenarios

Here are some examples of how multimodal prompts can be applied:

| Scenario                | Task                                                                                                                                      | Example Output Fields                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resume screening**    | Extract candidate name, email, phone, current title, years of experience, and key skills.                                                 | Candidate Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Current Job Title, Years of Experience, Key Skills         |
| **Invoice processing**  | Extract vendor information, invoice date, total amount, and line items from this invoice.                                                 | Vendor Name, Invoice Date, Total Amount, Invoice Line Items                                             |
| **Form analysis**       | Analyze this application form and extract all filled fields.                                                                              | Field Name (e.g., Applicant Name), Entered Value (e.g., John Doe), ...                                  |
| **ID document verification** | Extract name, ID number, expiration date, and address from this identification document. Verify that all text is clearly readable and flag any unclear sections. | Full Name, Identification Number, Expiration Date, Address, Unclear Sections Flag                        |

## ⚙️ Model selection in AI Builder

## 📊 Output formats: Text vs JSON

Choosing the right output format is critical for downstream processing.

### When to use text output

Text output works well for:

- Human-readable summaries
- Simple classifications
- Content that doesn't need structured processing

### When to use JSON output

JSON output is essential for:

- Structured data extraction
- Integration with databases or systems
- Power Automate flow processing
- Consistent field mapping

### JSON best practices

1. **Define clear field names**: Use descriptive, consistent naming
1. **Provide examples**: Include sample output and values for each field
1. **Specify data types**: Include examples for dates, numbers, and text
1. **Handle missing data**: Plan for null or empty values
1. **Validate structure**: Test with various document types

### Document quality considerations

- **Resolution**: Ensure images are clear and readable
- **Orientation**: Rotate documents to proper orientation before processing
- **Format support**: Test with your specific document types (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- **Size limits**: Be aware of file size restrictions in your environment

### Performance optimization

- **Choose appropriate models**: Upgrade models only when needed
- **Optimize prompts**: Often, shorter, clearer instructions perform better
- **Error handling**: Plan for documents that can't be processed
- **Monitor costs**: Different models consume different amounts of AI Builder credits

## 🧪Lab 7: Building a resume extraction system

Time to put your multimodal training into action, Operative. You'll construct a sophisticated resume extraction system that analyzes candidate documents and transforms them into structured intelligence for your hiring workflow.

### Mission prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Your **Hiring Agent** from previous missions open in Copilot Studio
- Access to the Dataverse environment with candidate storage tables
- The Application Intake Agent configured from Mission 02
- Sample resume documents from [test Resumes](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/microsoft/agent-academy/tree/main/operative/sample-data/resumes&filename=operative_sampledata)

!!! note "Mission 7 starter solution"
    This mission builds on your multi-agent hiring system from previous operations. If you need a fresh start, you can import the Mission 08 starter solution which includes all required components.

### 1. Create a multimodal prompt

Your first objective: create a prompt capable of analyzing resume documents and extracting structured data.

1. Sign in to [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.preview.microsoft.com) and select **Tools** from the left navigation.

1. Select **+ New tool**, then select **Prompt**.

1. Rename the prompt from the default timestamp name (E.g. *Custom prompt 09/04/2025, 04:59:11 PM*) to `Summarize Resume`.

1. In the Instructions field, add this prompt:

    ```text
    You are tasked with extracting key candidate information from a resume and cover letter to facilitate matching with open job roles and creating a summary for application review.
    
    Instructions:
    1. Extract Candidate Details:
        - Identify and extract the candidate’s full name.
        - Extract contact information, specifically the email address.
    2. Create Candidate Summary:
        - Summarize the candidate’s profile as multiline text (max 2000 characters) with the following sections:
            - Candidate name
            - Role(s) applied for if present
            - Contact and location
            - One-paragraph summary
            - Experience snapshot (last 2–3 roles with outcomes)
            - Key projects (1–3 with metrics)
            - Education and certifications
            - Top skills (Top 10)
            - Availability and work authorization
    
    Guidelines:
    - Extract information only from the provided resume and cover letter documents.
    - Ensure accuracy in identifying all details such as contact details and skills.
    - The summary should be concise but informative, suitable for quick application review.
    
    Resume: /document
    CoverLetter: /text
    ```

    !!! tip "Use Copilot assistance"
        You can use "Get started with Copilot" to generate your prompt using natural language. Try asking Copilot to create a prompt to summarize a resume!

1. Configure the input parameters:

    | Parameter | Type | Name | Sample Data |
    |-----------|------|------|-------------|
    | Resume | Image or document | Resume | Upload a sample resume from the test-data folder |
    | CoverLetter | Text | CoverLetter | Here is a Resume! |

1. Select **Test** to see the initial text output from your prompt.

### 2. Configure JSON output

Now you'll convert the prompt to output structured JSON data instead of plain text.

1. Add this JSON format specification to the end of your prompt instructions:

    ```text
    Output Format:
    Provide the output in valid JSON format with the following structure:
    
    {
        "CandidateName": "string",
        "Email": "string",
        "Summary": "string max 2000 characters",
        "Skills":[ 
        {"SkillName":"string", "SkillLevel":"5 highest, 1 lowest"}
        ],
    "Experience":[
        {"Employer":"string", "StartYear":"number","EndYear":"number (leave blank if present)"}
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Change the **Output** setting from "Text" to **JSON**.

1. Select **Test** again to verify the output is now formatted as JSON.

1. Optional: Experiment with different AI models to see how outputs vary, then return to the default model.

    ```

    Replace `/Summarize Resume` by inserting a reference to the **Summarize Resume agent flow** by typing forward slash (`/)` or selecting `/Summarize` to insert the reference.

### 7. Test your agent

Test your complete multimodal system to ensure everything works correctly.

1. **Start testing**:
    - Select **Test** to open the test panel
    - Type: `Here is a candidate Resume`

1. **Upload a resume**:
    - Upload one of the sample resumes from [test Resumes](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/microsoft/agent-academy/tree/main/operative/sample-data/resumes&filename=operative_sampledata)
    - The agent should process the resume and provide a structured response

1. **Verify the results**:
    - Check that you receive a Resume Number (format: R#####)
    - Verify you get a Candidate Number and summary
    - Use the activity map to see both the Resume upload tool and Summarize Resume tool in action

1. **Check data persistence**:
    - Navigate to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com)
    - Open **Apps** → **Hiring Hub** → **Play**
    - Go to **Resumes** to verify the resume was uploaded and processed
    - Check **Candidates** to see the extracted candidate information

!!! tip "Troubleshooting"
    - **Resume not processing**: Ensure the file is a PDF and under size limits
    - **No candidate created**: Check that the email was extracted correctly from the resume
    - **JSON format errors**: Verify your prompt instructions include the exact JSON structure
    - **Flow errors**: Check that all Dataverse connections and expressions are configured correctly

### Production readiness notes

To make this agent flow production ready you would also need to consider the following:

1. Error handling - if the Resume Number was not found, or the prompt failed to parse the document, error handling should be added to return a clear error to the agent.
1. Updating existing Candidates - the candidate is found using the email, then the name could be updated to match that on the resume
1. Splitting the Resume summarization and the Candidate creation - This functionality could be split into small agent flows to make them easier to maintain, and then the agent given instructions to use them in turn.
