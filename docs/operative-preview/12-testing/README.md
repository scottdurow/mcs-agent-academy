# 🚨 Mission 12: Validate & Scale Agent Quality with Copilot Studio Kit

## 🕵️‍♂️ CODENAME: `OPERATION TEST FLIGHT or BIT CHECK`

> **⏱️ Operation Time Window:** `~30 minutes`

## 🎯 Mission Brief

Welcome back, Agent.

In your previous mission, you learned how to collect real intelligence from the field: thumbs feedback, CSAT signals, Adaptive Card follow-ups, and even custom telemetry.

This final mission is what you do **after** you’ve heard the truth from the field.

**Operation Bit Check** is about turning user feedback and edge-case pain into a repeatable, automated quality gate. You’ll use the **Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit** to configure test automation, build structured test sets (including AI-scored validations), and run test executions you can repeat every time you change prompts, topics, tools, or knowledge.

Because shipping agents without tests is like deploying code you never ran. Bold strategy. Terrible outcome.

At the end, you’ll be ready to **publish** with confidence and you’ll do that final publish step on your own, because you’re not a trainee anymore.

## 🔎 Objectives

In this mission, you’ll learn:

1. What the Copilot Studio Kit is and why it matters for agent QA at scale
1. How to configure your agent for automated testing using an agent configuration + token endpoint approach
1. How to create structured test sets and cover multiple validation styles (exact match + AI-assisted validation)
1. How to execute test runs and interpret results (pass/fail, response comparison, and insights)
1. What other “ops-grade” tools are included in the kit (KPIs, UI helpers, inventory, review tools) so you know what to explore next

### Prerequisites

- Complete

### 12.1 Installing the Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit

1. Navigate to Copilot Studio Kit in [AppSource](http://aka.ms/DownloadCopilotStudioKit)
1. Click Get it now
1. Sign-in if required
1. You are presented with Install Copilot Studio Kit view
1. From the drop-down list, select the environment where you want to deploy Copilot Studio Kit
1. Carefully study the presented Terms and Statements, if you agree, check the boxes to indicate that and click Install. Installation will begin

### 12.2 Create your Test Case

## ✅ Mission Complete

Congratulations, Operative. This is the last module — and you earned it.

You now have the full agent lifecycle loop:

- **Build capability** (tools, knowledge, integrations)
- **Collect feedback** (signals from real users)
- **Turn signals into tests** (repeatable validation)
- **Iterate with confidence** (ship improvements without regressions)

Until next time, stay sharp. The future of enterprise work runs through agents—and now you know how to build one.

### ⏭️ What’s next (done on your own)

Your next move is to **publish** your agent to the channel that matches your scenario (Teams, demo website, etc.), then run this same loop continuously:
feedback → tests → improvements → publish.

That’s not a lab anymore. That’s a practice. And it’s how agents survive contact with reality.
