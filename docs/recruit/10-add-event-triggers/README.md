## 🎯 Mission Brief

It's time to elevate your agent from conversational assistant to autonomous operative. Your mission is to enable your agent to act without being summoned - responding to signals from across your digital domain with precision and speed.

With Event Triggers, you'll train your agent to monitor external systems like SharePoint, Teams, and Outlook, and execute intelligent actions the moment a signal is received. This operation transforms your agent into a fully operational field asset - silent, swift, and always watching.

Success means building agents that initiate value - not just respond to it.

## 🔎 Objectives

📖 This lesson will cover:

- Understanding Event Triggers and how they enable autonomous agent behavior
- Learning the difference between event triggers and topic triggers, including trigger workflows and payloads
- Exploring common Event Trigger scenarios
- Understanding authentication, security, and publishing considerations for event-driven agents
- Building an autonomous IT Help Desk agent that responds to SharePoint events and sends email acknowledgments

## 🤔 What is an Event Trigger?

An **Event Trigger** is a mechanism that allows your agent to act autonomously in response to external events, without requiring direct user input. Think of it as making your agent "watch" for specific events and automatically take action when those events occur.

Unlike topic triggers, which require users to type something to activate a conversation, event triggers activate based on things happening in your connected systems. E.g.:

- When a new file is created in SharePoint or OneDrive for Business
- When a record is created in Dataverse
- When a task is completed in Planner
- When a new Microsoft Form response is submitted
- When a new Microsoft Teams message is added
- Based on a recurring schedule (like daily reminders)

### Why Event Triggers matter in autonomous agents

Event triggers transform your agent from a reactive assistant into a proactive, autonomous helper:

1. **Autonomous operation** - your agent can work 24/7 without human intervention, responding to events as they happen.
    - *Example:* Automatically welcome new team members when they're added to a team.

1. **Real-time responsiveness** - instead of waiting for users to ask questions, your agent responds immediately to relevant events.
    - *Example*: Alert the IT team when a SharePoint document is modified.

1. **Workflow automation** - chain together multiple actions based on a single trigger event.
    - *Example:* When a new support ticket is created, create a task, notify the manager, and update the tracking dashboard.

1. **Consistent processes** - ensure important steps never get missed by automating responses to key events.
    - *Example:* Every new employee automatically gets onboarding materials and access requests.

1. **Data-driven actions** - use information from the triggering event to make smart decisions and take appropriate actions.
    - *Example:* Route urgent tickets to senior staff based on priority level in the trigger payload.

## ⚙️ How do Event Triggers work?

Event triggers operate through a three-step workflow that enables your agent to respond autonomously to external events:

### The trigger workflow

1. **Event Detection** - A specific event occurs in a connected system (SharePoint, Teams, Outlook, etc.)
1. **Trigger Activation** - The event trigger detects this event and sends a payload to your agent via a Power Automate Cloud Flow.
1. **Agent Response** - Your agent receives the payload and executes the instructions you've defined

### Event vs Topic triggers

Understanding the difference between these two trigger types is crucial:

| **Event Triggers** | **Topic Triggers** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Activated by external system events | Activated by user input/phrases |
| Enable autonomous agent behavior | Enable conversational responses |
| Use maker's authentication | Option for user's authentication |
| Run without user interaction | Require user to start conversation |
| Examples: File created, email received | Example: "What's the weather?" |

## 📦 Understanding trigger payloads

When an event occurs, the trigger sends a **payload** to your agent containing information about the event and instructions on how to respond.

### Default vs custom payloads

Every trigger type comes with a default payload structure, but you can customize it:

**Default payload** - Uses the standard format like `Use content from {Body}`

- Contains basic event information
- Uses generic processing instructions
- Good for simple scenarios

**Custom payload** - Add specific instructions and data formatting

- Include detailed directions for your agent
- Specify exactly what data to use and how
- Better for complex workflows

### Agent instructions vs custom payload instructions

You have two places to guide your agent's behavior with event triggers:

**Agent Instructions** (Global)

- Broad guidance that applies to all triggers
- Example: "When processing tickets, always check for duplicates first"
- Best for general behavior patterns

**Payload Instructions** (Trigger-specific)

- Specific directions for individual trigger types  
- Example: "For this SharePoint update, send a summary to the project channel"
- Best for complex agents with multiple triggers

💡 **Pro tip**: Avoid conflicting instructions between these two levels, as this can cause unexpected behavior.

## 🎯 Common Event Trigger scenarios

Here are practical examples of how event triggers can enhance your agent:

### IT Help Desk Agent

- **Trigger**: New SharePoint list item (support ticket)
- **Action**: Automatically categorize, assign priority, and notify appropriate team members

### Employee Onboarding Agent

- **Trigger**: New user added to Dataverse
- **Action**: Send welcome message, create onboarding tasks, and provision access

### Project Management Agent

- **Trigger**: Task completed in Planner
- **Action**: Update project dashboard, notify stakeholders, and check for blockers

### Document Management Agent

- **Trigger**: File uploaded to specific SharePoint folder
- **Action**: Extract metadata, apply tags, and notify document owners

### Meeting Assistant Agent

- **Trigger**: Calendar event created
- **Action**: Send pre-meeting reminders and agenda, book resources

## ⚠️ Publishing and authentication considerations

Before your agent can use event triggers in production, you need to understand authentication and security implications.

### Maker authentication

Event triggers use the **agent creator's credentials** for all authentication:

- Your agent accesses systems using your permissions
- Users can potentially access data through your credentials
- All actions are performed "as you" even when users interact with the agent

### Data protection best practices

To maintain security when publishing agents with event triggers:

1. **Evaluate data access** - Review what systems and data your triggers can access
1. **Test thoroughly** - Understand what information triggers include in payloads
1. **Narrow trigger scope** - Use specific parameters to limit what events activate triggers
1. **Review payload data** - Ensure triggers don't expose sensitive information
1. **Monitor usage** - Track trigger activity and resource consumption

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting and limitations

Keep these important considerations in mind when working with event triggers:

### Quota and billing impacts

- Each trigger activation counts toward your message consumption
- Frequent triggers (like every-minute recurrence) can quickly consume quota
- Monitor usage to avoid throttling

### Technical requirements

- Only available for agents with generative orchestration enabled
- Requires solution-aware cloud flow sharing to be enabled in your environment

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

- Your organization's DLP policies determine which triggers are available
- Administrators can block event triggers entirely
- Contact your admin if expected triggers aren't available

## 🧪 Lab 10 - Add Event Triggers for autonomous agent behavior

### 🎯 Use case

You'll enhance your IT Help Desk agent to automatically respond to new support requests. When someone creates a new item in your SharePoint support tickets list, your agent will:

1. Trigger autonomously when the SharePoint ticket is created
1. Provide the ticket details and instructions on the steps that you want it to perform
1. Automatically acknowledge the ticket to the submitter via an AI generated email

This lab demonstrates how event triggers enable truly autonomous agent behavior.
