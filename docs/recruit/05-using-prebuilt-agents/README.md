# üß∞ Mission 05: Using a Pre-Built Agent  

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CODENAME: `OPERATION SAFE TRAVELS`

> **‚è±Ô∏è Operation Time Window:** `~30 minutes`

## üéØ Mission Brief

Welcome to your next mission in the Copilot Studio Agent Academy. You're about to explore the world of **pre-built agents**‚Äîintelligent, purpose-driven agents created by Microsoft to accelerate your deployment and reduce time to value.

Rather than building from scratch, pre-built agents (also called **agent templates**) give you a head start by providing ready-to-use scenarios that you can customize and deploy in minutes.

In this mission, you‚Äôll deploy the **Safe Travels** agent‚Äîan agent that helps your users prepare for business travel, understand company policies, and streamline planning.

Your goals for this mission are:

1. Understand what pre-built agents are and why they matter

## üß† What Are Pre-Built Agents?

Pre-built agents are turnkey AI agents created by Microsoft that:

- Address common business needs (like travel, HR, IT support)
- Include fully functioning topics, trigger phrases, instructions and sample knowledge.
- Can be edited, extended, and grounded with your own data

These agents are perfect for getting started quickly or learning how agents are structured.
