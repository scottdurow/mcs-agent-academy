## 🎯 Mission Brief

Welcome to your first field assignment, Agent Maker. You’ve been selected to design, equip, and deploy a Declarative Agent—a specialized operative embedded directly into Microsoft 365 Copilot and Teams.

Unlike traditional agents, declarative agents operate with a defined mission (instructions), tools (prompts/connectors), and strategic access to internal intelligence (knowledge sources like SharePoint, Dataverse, and more). Your job is to build this agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio—a no-code command center where your agent’s skills and purpose come to life.

Let’s go.

## 🔎 Objectives

In this mission, you’ll learn:

1. Understanding what declarative agents are and how they extend Microsoft 365 Copilot with custom capabilities
1. Comparing Microsoft Copilot Studio vs. Copilot Studio agent builder for building declarative agents
1. Creating a declarative agent using natural language through the conversational creation experience
1. Adding AI prompts as tools to enhance your agent's specialized knowledge and problem-solving abilities
1. Publishing and testing your declarative agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams

## 🕵🏻‍♀️ What is a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot?

Declarative agents are tailored versions of Microsoft 365 Copilot. You can customize Microsoft 365 Copilot to meet specific business needs by providing it with instructions to support a particular process, ground it with enterprise knowledge, and leverage tools for wider extensibility. This allows organizations to create personalized experiences with greater functionality for their users.

## 🤔 Why would I use Microsoft Copilot Studio to build a declarative agent?

### 👩🏻‍💼 Understanding Business-to-Employee (B2E)

Business-to-Employee (B2E) refers to the interactions and services that a business provides directly to its employees. In the context of an agent, it means using the advanced capabilities of Copilot Studio to support and enhance the work experience of employees within the organization.

### ✨ Use case scenario

**As an** employee

**I want to** get quick and accurate help from the IT helpdesk agent for issues like device problems, network troubleshooting, printer setup

**So that I can** stay productive and resolve technical issues without delays

Let's begin!

### Prerequisites

- Users and makers must have a license to use Microsoft 365 Copilot.
- Makers must have permissions to create in and have access to a Copilot Studio environment.

### 3.1 Create a declarative agent

1. Navigate to [https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/) and sign in using your credentials. Make sure to switch to your environment that you're using for these labs.

1. Select **Agents** from the menu and select **Copilot for Microsoft 365**.

       ![Copilot for Microsoft 365](assets/3.1_02_CopilotForM365.png)

1. Next, we're going to create a declarative agent by selecting **+ Add** agent.

       ![Add Agent](assets/3.1_03_AddAgent.png)

1. We'll then see the conversational creation experience load where we can chat in natural language with Copilot to describe the declarative agent we want to build, and use the provided questions for guidance.

       Let's enter a detailed description that outlines the following,  
       - the task of the agent  
       - what type of inquiries it can handle  
       - the format of its response  
       - the goal of the agent  
    
       ```text
       You are a highly skilled and experienced IT professional specializing in a wide range of computer systems, networking, and cybersecurity. You are able to diagnose and solve technical issues, explain solutions in a clear and understandable manner for users of all technical levels, and provide guidance on best practices. You should be concise and informative, using step-by-step instructions with bullet points when appropriate. Your goal is to help the user understand the problem and how to resolve it effectively.
       ```
    
       ![Create Prompt](assets/3.1_04_CreatePrompt.png)

1. After submitting the prompt, a noticeable update will appear on the right hand side pane with the details and instructions of the agent as defined by the prompt. Next you'll be asked to confirm the name of your agent and Copilot will have suggested a name.

       Either enter `yes` to accept the suggested name or enter a different name such as the following,
    
       ```text
       Contoso Tech Support Pro
       ```
    
       ![Instructions updated](assets/3.1_05_InstructionsUpdated.png)

      > The Copilot conversational creation experience can vary each time where the provided questions for guidance may be slightly different than previously.

1. The name of the agent has now been updated as seen on the right hand side pane. We're now asked to refine the instructions for the agent. The instructions on the right hand side pane is already suitable as it covers the topics we want - refer to yellow highlighted text in screenshot below. Instead, we'll expand on how it should format its response and the tone. We'll enter the following,

      ```text
      Concise and Informative:
      - Bullet Points: Use bullet points for clarity and to break down information into digestible parts.
      - Summarize: Provide a brief summary of the solution at the end of the explanation.
   
      User-Friendly Communication:
      - Empathy: Show empathy and understanding of the user's frustration or confusion.
      - Encouragement: Encourage users by acknowledging their efforts and progress.
   
      Interactive and Engaging:
      - Ask for Feedback: After providing a solution, ask if the user needs further assistance or if the solution worked.
      ```

      ![Name updated](assets/3.1_06_NameUpdated.png)

1. Next we'll be asked if we want to add any publicly accessible websites or knowledge. I'll respond with `No` as we will only be adding a prompt for our declarative agent in this lab. Subsequent labs in future lessons will cover knowledge sources.

      ![No websites or knowledge sources added](assets/3.1_07_KnowledgeSources.png)

1. We'll then see a response from Copilot that we have now finished configuring our agent using the Copilot conversational creation experience. Click **Create** to provision the declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot.

       > **Reminder:** The Copilot conversational creation experience can vary each time where the provided questions for guidance may be slightly different than previously. So you may be seeing a different message from Copilot at the end of your configuration.

      ![Create agent](assets/3.1_08_CreateDeclarativeAgent.png)

1. Once the agent has been provisioned, you'll see the details of the agent which contains the description and the instructions defined during the Copilot conversational creation experience.

      ![Agent details](assets/3.1_09_01_AgentDetails.png)

      Scroll down the pane and you'll also see the capabilities of adding knowledge, enabling web search (via Bing), starter prompts and the publish details of the declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot. The starter prompts will also be displayed in the test pane on the right hand side. Users can select these starter prompts to begin interacting with the agent.

      ![Additional capabilities](assets/3.1_09_02_SuggestedPrompts.png)

1. In the Details section of the agent, you have the ability to change the agent icon as well. Select **Edit**.

      ![Edit details](assets/3.1_10_01_EditDetails.png)

      Here you can change the icon and the background color. Select **Save** and then select **Save** again to update the details of the agent.

      ![Change icon](assets/3.1_10_02_ChangeIcon.png)

1. Let's do a quick test of the agent we've created. Select one of the **Starter Prompts** in the test pane on the left hand side.

      ![Change icon](assets/3.1_11_TestUsingStarterPrompt.png)

1. Our agent will then respond. Notice how it adhered to the instructions by providing bullet points into digestible parts, and used empathy in its response.

      ![Change icon](assets/3.1_12_TestResponse.png)

    If you scroll to the bottom of the message, notice how it also asked for feedback after providing a solution as instructed.

      ![Change icon](assets/3.1_13_TestResponse.png)

In a few minutes you've added a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot in Copilot Studio 🙌🏻

Next we'll learn how to add a tool to our agent, we'll create a prompt.

### 3.2 Create and add a prompt for your declarative agent

1. Scroll down to the **Tools** section and select **+ Add tool**

      ![Add tool](assets/3.2_01_AddTool.png)

1. The Tools modal will appear and a list of Power Platform connectors is displayed. To add a Prompt, select **+ New tool**.

      ![New tool](assets/3.2_02_NewTool.png)

1. A list of other tools is displayed - Prompt, Custom connector, REST API and Model Context Protocol. If your organization meets the [requirements for Computer Use](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot-studio/computer-use?tabs=new#requirements/?WT.mc_id=power-172614-ebenitez), this will also appear in the list. Select **Prompt**.

      ![Select prompt](assets/3.2_03_SelectPrompt.png)

1. Enter a name for the prompt. Let's name our prompt `IT Expert`.

      ![Enter name](assets/3.2_04_NamePrompt.png)

1. Select the **chevron icon** next to the **Model** to see the different chat models you can choose from. By default, the **Basic GPT-4o mini** model is selected and you also have the option to bring-your-own-model using Azure AI Foundry Models. We'll stick with the selected default model.

      ![Change model](assets/3.2_05_ChangeModel.png)

1. Next, we'll provide our prompt with instructions. There's 3 methods that you can choose from

      - Use Copilot to generate instructions for you based on your description of what you want the prompt to do.
      - Use a preset template from the prompt library to create a prompt.
      - Manually enter your own instructions.

1. Let's first try using Copilot to generate instructions based on a description entered. Enter the following into the Copilot field and submit.

      ```text
      I need an IT expert that can help answer questions related to networking, computer systems, user devices and anything else IT related
      ```

      ![Get started with Copilot](assets/3.2_07_UseCopilot_EnterPrompt.png)

1. Copilot will then begin to generate a prompt for us.

      ![Copilot drafts prompts](assets/3.2_08_CopilotDraftingPrompt.png)

1. The Copilot generated draft instructions will then appear.

      ![Copilot generated draft instructions](assets/3.2_09_CopilotGeneratedInstructions.png)

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the instructions and you'll see the user input parameter already defined by Copilot. You then have the option to
    - Keep the draft instructions generated.
    - Refresh the draft instructions using Copilot.
    - Clear the draft instructions.

        Clear the draft instructions by selecting the **trash bin** icon and we'll next try the prompt library.

        ![Prompt instructions](assets/3.2_10_Options.png)

1. Select the **prompt library** link.

    ![Select prompt library](assets/3.2_11_SelectPromptLibrary.png)

1. You'll see a list of prompt templates to choose from. These are from the [Power Platform Prompt library](https://aka.ms/power-prompts).

    ![Prompt library](assets/3.2_12_PromptLibrary.png)

1. Search for the `IT expert` prompt and select it.

    ![Select IT expert prompt](assets/3.2_13_ITExpertPrompt.png)

1. The prompt will then be added as the instructions with the input parameter as defined by the prompt template. Similar to the approach we took when providing instructions for our agent during the conversational creation experience with Copilot, this prompt template outlines
    - a task,
    - what type of inquiries it can handle,
    - and the format of its response and the goal of the prompt.

    ![Prompt instructions](assets/3.2_14_ITExpertPromptInstructions.png)

1. Clear the instructions and we'll next try manually entering the instructions. We'll use the [IT Expert prompt](https://adoption.microsoft.com/sample-solution-gallery/sample/pnp-powerplatform-prompts-it-expert/) from the [Power Platform Prompt library](https://aka.ms/power-prompts). Copy and paste the prompt.

    ```text
    I want you to act as an IT Expert. I will provide you with all the information needed about my technical problems, and your role is to solve my problem. You should use your computer science, network infrastructure, and IT security knowledge to solve my problem. Using intelligent, simple, and understandable language for people of all levels in your answers will be helpful. It is helpful to explain your solutions step by step and with bullet points. Try to avoid too many technical details, but use them when necessary. I want you to reply with the solution, not write any explanations. My problem is [Problem]
    ```

    ![Prompt instructions](assets/3.2_15_PromptInstructions.png)

1. Next, we can define the user input parameters of our prompt. These can be text and images, and sample data to test with. There's also the capability to ground the prompt with knowledge from Dataverse tables. For this exercise, we only have one user input to define which is the problem input. This is currently a placeholder in our prompt as `[Problem]`. We'll now configure this input either by entering the `/` character or selecting **+Add content** and then select **Text**.

    ![Text input](assets/3.2_16_AddContent.png)

1. We can now enter a name for our input parameter and sample data.

    Enter the following as the name

    ```text
    problem input
    ```

    Enter the following as the sample data

    ```text
    My laptop gets an error with a blue screen
    ```

    Then select **Close**.

    ![Configure problem input](assets/3.2_17_NameSampleData.png)

1. The problem input parameter will now be added to the instructions with the configured sample data. We can now test our prompt!

    ![Problem input added](assets/3.2_18_InputAdded.png)

1. Select **Test** to the test the prompt.

    ![Test instructions](assets/3.2_19_Test.png)

1. The response will then display. Notice how the response provides headings with bullet points as per the instructions. Scroll down and review the remainder of the model response.

    ![Model response](assets/3.2_20_ModelResponse.png)

1. Before we save our prompt, let's learn about the settings that can be configured for this prompt. Select the **ellipsis (...) icon**.

    ![Prompt settings](assets/3.2_21_Settings.png)

1. Here we'll see three settings that can be configured.

    - **Temperature**: Lower temperatures lead to predictable results, while higher temperatures allow more diverse or creative responses.
    - **Record retrieval**: Specify the number of records retrieved for your knowledge sources.
    - **Include links in the response**: When selected, the response includes link citations for the retrieved records.

    Select the **X** icon to exit from Settings.

    ![Configure settings](assets/3.2_22_ConfigureSettings.png)

1. Select **Save** to save the prompt.

    ![Save prompt](assets/3.2_23_SavePrompt.png)

1. Next, select **Add to agent** to add the prompt to our declarative agent.

    ![Prompt instructions](assets/3.2_24_AddToAgent.png)

1. The prompt will now appear under Tools 🙌🏻

    ![Prompt added](assets/3.2_25_PromptAdded.png)

We'll next update our instructions to invoke the prompt and test our declarative agent.

### 3.3 Update instructions and test your declarative agent

1. Scroll up to the **Details** section and select **Edit**. This will enable the fields to be editable.

      ![Select Edit](assets/3.3_01_EditInstructions.png)

1. We can now update our instructions to invoke our prompt by referencing the name of the prompt. Clear the instructions, then copy and paste the following.

      ```text
      - When a user asks questions about their device, run the "IT Expert" prompt. Use their question as the problem input of the "IT Expert" prompt.
      ```

      Notice how the final sentence is instructing the agent to use the question asked by the user as the value for the problem input parameter. The agent will use the question as the problem input for the prompt. Next, select **Save**.

      ![Update instructions to invoke prompt](assets/3.3_02_UpdateInstructionsWithPrompt.png)

1. We're now ready to test our updated instructions of our declarative agent. Select the **refresh icon** in the test pane.

      ![Select refresh icon](assets/3.3_03_RefreshTestPane.png)

1. Next, enter the following prompt below and submit.

       ```text
       Can you help me, my laptop is encountering a blue screen
       ```

      ![Perform test](assets/3.3_04_PerformTest.png)

1. The agent invokes the prompt and responds, with a citation to the agent.

      ![Prompt instructions](assets/3.3_05_ModelResponse.png)

Let's now publish our declarative agent 😃

### 3.4 Publish your declarative agent to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Teams

1. Our declarative agent will load next. We can see the starter prompts to select from which quickly enables users to seek immediate help.

      Let's select the **Hardware Problem** prompt which will automatically prepopulate the message Copilot field. Submit the question to Copilot.

      ![Select starter prompt](assets/3.4_08_SelectStarterPrompt.png)

1. The agent will then invoke our **IT Expert** prompt and we'll see the model response returned as a message in our declarative agent.

      ![Response](assets/3.4_09_Response.png)

1. But _how do we know_ the declarative agent invoked the prompt? 👀 Well, here's a tip!

      > You can test and debug agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot by enabling [developer mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/debugging-copilot-agent#use-developer-mode-in-copilot-chat/?WT.mc_id=power-172614-ebenitez).

    Enter the following in the message Copilot field and submit.

    ```text
    -developer on
    ```

    A confirmation message will appear to let you know developer mode is now enabled.

    ![Developer mode enabled](assets/3.4_10_DeveloperModeEnabled.png)

1. Submit the following question to invoke the prompt.

    ```text
    Can you help me, my laptop is encountering a blue screen
    ```

    ![Enter question](assets/3.4_11_EnterQuestion.png)

1. We'll see a model response from our **IT Expert** prompt again returned as a message. Scroll down to the bottom of the message and a card with debug information is displayed.

    Expand **Agent Debug Info** by selecting it.

    ![Agent debug info](assets/3.4_12_AgentDebugInfo.png)

1. Here you'll find information on the agent metadata that occurred at runtime. In our use case, we'll be focusing on the _Actions_ section

    - **Matched actions** highlight the current status of functions found during the app's search.
    - **Selected actions** highlight the current status of functions chosen to run based on the app's decision-making process.

    So here we can see the agent orchestrator chose to invoke the IT Expert prompt as per the instructions of our declarative agent. This is further outlined in the _Executed Actions_ section which also tells us that it successfully invoked the prompt.

    ![Review agent debug info](assets/3.4_13_ReviewAgentDebugInfo.png)

1. To turn off developer mode, enter the following in the message Copilot field and submit.

    ```text
