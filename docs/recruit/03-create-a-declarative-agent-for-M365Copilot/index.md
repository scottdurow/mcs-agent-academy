## 🎯 Mission Brief {#mission-brief}

Welcome back, Recruit. You’ve been selected to design, equip, and deploy a declarative agent—a specialized agent embedded directly in Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams.

Unlike traditional agents, declarative agents operate with a defined mission (instructions), tools (prompts/connectors), and strategic access to internal intelligence (knowledge sources like SharePoint, Dataverse, and more). Your job is to build this agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio—a no-code command center where your agent’s skills and purpose come to life.

Let’s go.

> [!IMPORTANT] This mission uses the classic Copilot Studio experience
> If your Copilot Studio screen looks different from the screenshots in this mission, turn off **New Experience** in the upper-right corner to switch back to the **classic experience** used here.

1. Let's do a quick test of the agent we've created. In the test pane, select a **Starter Prompt**, such as `Explain IT Terms`.

    Review the response. Notice how the agent followed its instructions by organizing the answer into digestible bullet points and providing a summary.

    ![Response from the agent after selecting a suggested prompt](assets/3.1_11_TestResponse.png)

In a few minutes you've added a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot in Copilot Studio 🙌🏻

Next we'll learn how to add a tool to our agent, we'll create a prompt.

### 3.2 Create and add a prompt for your declarative agent

1. Scroll down to the **Tools** section and select **+ Add tool**

    ![Add tool](assets/3.2_01_AddTool.png)

1. The Tools modal will appear and you can either create a new tool or select from the list of tools available. By default, a list of Power Platform connectors is displayed. Since we are going to add a Prompt, select **Prompt** under **Create new**.

    ![Select prompt](assets/3.2_02_SelectPrompt.png)

1. The Prompt modal appears, this is where we can define our prompt for our agent.

    Enter a name for the prompt. Let's name our prompt `IT Expert`.

    ![Prompt name field containing IT Expert](assets/3.2_03_NamePrompt.png)

1. Select the **chevron icon** next to the **Model** to see the different [chat models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/prompt-model-settings) you can choose from. The default model select is **Basic GPT-4.1 mini**. You'll see a list of OpenAI models and [Anthropic models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/connect-to-ai-subprocessor) that you can select from. You also have the option to bring-your-own-model using Microsoft Foundry Models. We'll stick with the selected default model.

    ![Expanded Model list showing available chat models](assets/3.2_04_ChangeModel.png)

1. Next, we'll provide our prompt with instructions. There's 3 methods that you can choose from

    - Use Copilot to generate instructions for you based on your description of what you want the prompt to do.
    - Use a preset template from the prompt library to create a prompt.
    - Manually enter your own instructions.

1. Let's first try using Copilot to generate instructions based on a description entered. Enter the following into the Copilot field and submit.

    ```text
    I need an IT expert that can help answer questions related to networking, computer systems, user devices and anything else IT related
    ```

    ![Get started with Copilot](assets/3.2_05_UseCopilot_EnterPrompt.png)

1. Copilot will then begin to generate a prompt for us.

    ![Copilot drafts prompts](assets/3.2_06_CopilotDraftingPrompt.png)

1. The Copilot generated draft instructions will then appear.

    ![Copilot generated draft instructions](assets/3.2_07_CopilotGeneratedInstructions.png)

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the instructions and you'll see the user input parameter already defined by Copilot. You then have the option to
    - Keep the draft instructions generated.
    - Refresh the draft instructions using Copilot.
    - Clear the draft instructions.

    Clear the draft instructions by selecting the **trash bin** icon and we'll next try the prompt library.

    ![Copilot generated prompt instructions and options available](assets/3.2_07_CopilotGeneratedInstructions.png)

1. Select the **prompt template** link.

    ![Select prompt template](assets/3.2_08_SelectPromptTemplate.png)

1. You'll see a list of prompt templates to choose from. These are from the [Power Platform Prompt library](https://aka.ms/power-prompts).

    ![Prompt library](assets/3.2_09_PromptLibrary.png)

1. Search for the `IT expert` prompt and select it.

    ![Select IT expert prompt](assets/3.2_10_SelectITExpertPrompt.png)

1. The prompt will then be added as the instructions with the input parameter as defined by the prompt template. Similar to the approach we took when providing instructions for our agent during the conversational creation experience with Copilot, this prompt template outlines
    - a task,
    - what type of inquiries it can handle,
    - and the format of its response and the goal of the prompt.

    ![Prompt instructions](assets/3.2_11_ITExpertPromptInstructions.png)

1. Clear the instructions and we'll next try manually entering the instructions. We'll use the [IT Expert prompt](https://adoption.microsoft.com/sample-solution-gallery/sample/pnp-powerplatform-prompts-it-expert/) from the [Power Platform Prompt library](https://aka.ms/power-prompts). Copy and paste the prompt.

    ```text
    I want you to act as an IT Expert. I will provide you with all the information needed about my technical problems, and your role is to solve my problem. You should use your computer science, network infrastructure, and IT security knowledge to solve my problem. Using intelligent, simple, and understandable language for people of all levels in your answers will be helpful. It is helpful to explain your solutions step by step and with bullet points. Try to avoid too many technical details, but use them when necessary. I want you to reply with the solution, not write any explanations. My problem is [Problem]
    ```

    ![Prompt instructions](assets/3.2_12_PromptInstructions.png)

1. Next, we can define the user input parameters of our prompt. These can be text and images, and sample data to test with. There's also the capability to ground the prompt with knowledge from Dataverse tables. For this exercise, we only have one user input to define which is the problem input. This is currently a placeholder in our prompt as `[Problem]`. We'll now configure this input either by entering the `/` character or selecting **+Add content** and then select **Text**.

    ![Text input](assets/3.2_13_AddContent.png)

1. We can now enter a name for our input parameter and sample data.

    Enter the following as the name

    ```text
    problem input
    ```

    Enter the following as the sample data

    ```text
    My laptop restarted unexpectedly. Any advice?
    ```

    Then select **Close**.

    ![Configure problem input](assets/3.2_14_NameSampleData.png)

1. The problem input parameter will now be added to the instructions with the configured sample data. We can now test our prompt!

    Select **Test** to the test the prompt.

    ![Test prompt instructions](assets/3.2_15_TestPrompt.png)

1. The model will be in-progress of generating a response.

    ![Model in-progress of generating its response](assets/3.2_16_ModelResponse.png)

1. The response will then display. Notice how the response provides headings with bullet points as per the instructions. Scroll down and review the remainder of the model response.

    ![Model response](assets/3.2_17_ModelResponse.png)

1. Before we save our prompt, let's learn about the settings that can be configured for this prompt. Select **More options** (**...**).

    ![Prompt settings](assets/3.2_18_PromptSettings.png)

1. Here we'll see several settings that can be configured.

    - **Temperature**: Lower temperatures lead to predictable results, while higher temperatures allow more diverse or creative responses.
    - **Record retrieval**: Specify the number of records retrieved for your knowledge sources.
    - **Include links in the response**: When selected, the response includes link citations for the retrieved records.
    - **Enable code interpreter**: When this option is turned on, the code interpreter feature becomes active, allowing the agent to generate and run code.
    - **Content moderation level**: Lower content‑moderation levels allow more answers but increase the risk of harmful content. Higher moderation levels apply stricter filtering, reducing harmful content but also producing fewer answers.

    Select **Close** (X icon) to exit from **Settings**.

    ![Configure settings](assets/3.2_19_ConfigurePromptSettings.png)

1. Select **Save** to save the prompt.

    ![Save prompt](assets/3.2_20_SavePrompt.png)

We'll next update our instructions to invoke the prompt and test our declarative agent.

### 3.3 Update instructions and test your declarative agent

1. Scroll up to the **Details** section and select **Edit**. This will enable the fields to be editable.

    ![Select Edit](assets/3.3_01_EditInstructions.png)

1. We can now update our instructions to invoke our prompt by referencing the name of the prompt. Clear the instructions, then copy and paste the following.

    ```text
    When a user asks IT related questions such as questions on their device, run the "IT Expert- prompt". Use their question as the problem input of the "IT Expert- prompt".
    ```

    Notice how the final sentence is instructing the agent to use the question asked by the user as the value for the problem input parameter. The agent will use the question as the problem input for the prompt. Next, select **Save**.

    ![Update instructions to invoke prompt](assets/3.3_02_UpdateInstructionsWithPrompt.png)

1. We're now ready to test our updated instructions of our declarative agent. Select **Refresh** in the test pane.

    ![Test pane with Refresh control](assets/3.3_03_RefreshTestPane.png)

1. Next, enter the following prompt below and submit.

    ```text
    My laptop restarted unexpectedly. Any advice?
    ```

    ![Perform test](assets/3.3_04_PerformTest.png)

1. The agent invokes the prompt and responds.

    ![Model response](assets/3.3_05_ModelResponse.png)

    ![Model response](assets/3.3_06_ModelResponse.png)

> [!NOTE] Model responses may differ across sessions

1. We'll see a model response from our **IT Expert** prompt again returned as a message. Scroll down to the bottom of the message and a card with debug information is displayed.

    Expand **Agent Debug Info** by selecting it.

1. Here you'll find information on the agent metadata that occurred at runtime.

    In our use case, we'll be focusing on the _Actions_ section:

    - **Matched actions** highlight the current status of functions found during the app's search.
    - **Selected actions** highlight the current status of functions chosen to run based on the app's decision-making process.

    So here we can see the agent orchestrator chose to invoke the IT Expert prompt as per the instructions of our declarative agent.

    This is further outlined in the _Executed Actions_ section which also tells us that it successfully invoked the prompt and used our question as the value for our `problem input` parameter.

1. To turn off developer mode, enter the following in the message Copilot field and submit.

    ```text
    -developer off
    ```

    A confirmation message will appear to let you know developer mode is disabled. Cool, now you know how to verify whether your declarative agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot invoked your prompt 🌞

1. Microsoft Teams will then load in a new browser tab and we'll then be presented with the terms of use for Microsoft 365 Copilot, select **Agree**.

    ![Select Agree](assets/3.4_17_Agree.png)

1. In Microsoft 365 Copilot, confirm that the agents pane lists the **Contoso Tech Support Pro** declarative agent.

1. Select **More options** (**...**) in the Teams navigation. Search for **Contoso Tech Support Pro**, or select it if it is already listed.

    To keep the agent in the Teams navigation, open its context menu by right-clicking or pressing **Shift+F10**, then select **Pin**.

    ![Select and pin agent](assets/3.4_19_SelectAndPinAgentFromApps.png)

1. We'll then see our agent load. 1. Let's next test our agent. Enter the following prompt and submit.

    ```text
    Can you help me, my laptop is encountering a blue screen
    ```

    ![Pin agent](assets/3.4_20_EnterQuestion.png)

1. A model response from our prompt will then be displayed.
