# 🚨 Mission 05: Build a custom engine agent {#mission-05-build-a-custom-engine-agent}

<mission-meta />

> [!NOTE]
> This lab uses the **new Copilot Studio experience**.
> Make sure the **New experience** toggle in the upper-right corner of the Home page is **on** so your screen matches the screenshots in this lesson.

## 🎯 Mission Brief {#mission-brief}

Welcome back, Agent. In this mission, you'll build a new custom engine agent from scratch in Copilot Studio by using the AI-based authoring experience.

You'll describe what your agent needs to do in natural language, let Copilot Studio generate the initial agent experience, then refine the result by updating the agent name and adding knowledge sources.

Once the agent is created, you'll add it to your solution and test it so future missions can extend the same agent with more advanced capabilities.

## 🔎 Objectives {#objectives}

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. How to create a new custom engine agent in Copilot Studio by describing it in natural language
1. How to review and refine the generated agent details
1. How to add knowledge sources
1. How to run baseline tests before adding more functionality in upcoming labs
1. How to check that your solution contains the agent components

## 🧠 Why AI-based authoring matters {#why-ai-based-authoring-matters}

Copilot Studio gives you a faster path to a working custom agent by letting you start with natural language instead of building everything manually.

By creating the agent this way, you can:

- Start with an AI-generated draft for the agent's purpose, name, and instructions
- Establish a stable baseline before adding tools, actions, and orchestration patterns in later missions

## 🧪 Lab 05: Create a custom engine agent in Copilot Studio {#lab-05-create-a-custom-engine-agent-in-copilot-studio}

### ✨ Use case {#use-case}

We'll continue using the same IT helpdesk scenario introduced earlier in the course:

**As an** employee

**I want to** get quick and accurate IT support for common issues like device setup, network access, and troubleshooting

**So that I can** stay productive and resolve technical issues faster

### ✅ Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before starting this lab, make sure you have:

- The solution from [Lesson 04 - Creating a solution](../04-creating-a-solution/index.md)
- Access to Copilot Studio with the **new experience** enabled
- Your test knowledge source(s), for example the **Contoso IT** SharePoint site from [Lesson 00 - Course setup](../00-course-setup/index.md#step-4-create-new-sharepoint-site)

### 5.1 Create a new agent with AI-based authoring

1. Go to **Microsoft Copilot Studio** and on the **Home** page, copy and paste the following prompt into the field.

   ```text
   You are an IT Help Desk assistant that helps employees resolve common IT issues and find available devices. Be polite, concise, and helpful.
   Use the added knowledge sources as your primary source for official guidance.
   Do not invent steps. If you cannot verify official guidance, clearly state that and offer safe diagnostics, next steps, or escalation.

   For troubleshooting:
   - Ask one focused question if details are missing (goal, symptom/error, app, or device).
   - Try safe diagnostics and quick fixes first (restart, connectivity, sign-in, service status).
   - Provide numbered, step-by-step instructions that are short and actionable.
   - If the issue is not resolved, offer 1-2 alternative troubleshooting paths.
   -  After 2-3 troubleshooting paths, recommend escalation and provide a concise ticket summary that includes the symptoms, error messages, affected device or application, and troubleshooting steps already attempted.
   - Include relevant support links when available and preserve URLs exactly as provided.

   For device requests:
   - Ask what type of device is needed.
   - Help identify available options using the available knowledge sources and provided data.

   Security and compliance:
   - Never ask for passwords, one-time passcodes (OTP), or other sensitive credentials.
   - Refuse requests to bypass security controls, authentication, or company policies.

   Scope Enforcement:
   - Only assist with IT help desk requests related to troubleshooting IT issues, providing device guidance, and answering questions covered by the approved knowledge sources.
   - Do not respond to requests outside of this scope.
   ```

    ![Paste Prompt](./assets/5.1_01_PastePrompt.png)

1. This prompt contains the instructions used by the AI authoring experience to build the agent.

    Review them closely. They help the agent stay safe, follow company rules, and stay focused on approved IT help desk tasks, making responses more reliable, secure, and easier to test.

    Submit the prompt to begin the AI authoring experience and create the agent.

    ![Submit Prompt](./assets/5.1_02_SubmitPrompt.png)

1. In the prompt, the instructions included only referencing the added knowledge sources. In the **Requesting information** step of the authoring experience, it recognizes there are no knowledge sources that have been provided and asks you to provide these.

    Copy and paste the following text, be sure to update the SharePoint site with your site's URL.

   ```text
   https://YOURSITE.sharepoint.com/sites/ContosoIT, https://support.microsoft.com, https://learn.microsoft.com/troubleshoot
   ```

    ![Provide parameters](./assets/5.1_03_ProvideParameters.png)

    > [!WARNING] AI authoring experience may differ across sessions
    >
    > Each session can vary on how the AI authoring experience interacts with you. You may be asked during the **Requesting information** step to provide the knowledge sources, or you could provide these details in the **Complete** step. Expand the following learning block if you don't encounter providing the knowledge sources in the **Requesting information** step.

    To provide knowledge sources in the **Complete** step of the AI authoring experience, expand the following additional learning block.

    ::: details Provide knowledge sources via Make edits
    **Add knowledge sources in the Complete step**

    1. Once the custom agent has been designed, select **Make edits**.

       ![Select Make edits](./assets/5.1_04_Alternative_MakeEdits.png)

    1. Copy and paste the following text to add the knowledge sources.

   ```text
    Can you add these knowledge sources https://YOURSITE.sharepoint.com/sites/ContosoIT, https://support.microsoft.com, https://learn.microsoft.com/troubleshoot
   ```

       ![Paste knowledge sources](./assets/5.1_05_Alternative_AddKnowledgeSources.png)

    1. The authoring experience will run through the steps to add the knowledge sources. In the **Complete** step, you'll see confirmation and you can proceed to selecting **Keep it** to make no further changes.

       ![Select Keep it](./assets/5.1_07_Alternative_KeepIt.png)
    :::

1. After you provide the knowledge sources in the **Requesting information** step, the flow moves to **Building**. In this step, you can see Copilot Studio's reasoning as it assembles and prepares the agent.

    ![Building agent](./assets/5.1_08_BuildingAgent.png)

1. Eventually the agent is built and reaches the **Complete** step in the authoring experience. Select **Keep it** since no further changes need to be made.

    ![Select Keep it](./assets/5.1_09_Review.png)

1. To open the agent in Copilot Studio, select the agent under **Artifacts** on the right-hand side panel.

    ![Select agent](./assets/5.1_10_SelectAgent.png)

### 5.2 Refine agent details

1. In the **Build** tab, review what Copilot Studio assembled from your AI authoring session. In this view:

   1. **Instructions** were generated from the natural language prompt you provided earlier.
   1. **Skills** were automatically created based on the same prompt and the tasks the agent is expected to perform.
   1. **Knowledge** includes the sources you supplied during the authoring experience (for example, your SharePoint site and the websites you provided).

    ![Agent created](./assets/5.2_01_AgentCreated.png)

1. Update the agent name to the following text,

   ```text
    Contoso IT Concierge
   ```

    Next, review the agent settings by selecting the ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner.

    ![Rename agent](./assets/5.2_02_RenameAgent.png)

1. In the **Agent details** tab, inspect the **Solution** field. The associated solution will be the solution you created in the previous mission.

    ![Review agent details under settings](./assets/5.2_03_ReviewAgentSettings.png)

1. Next, select the **Greeting & prompts** tab and notice how the greeting message field has been automatically populated. We'll update this text to reflect the name of the agent.

    ![View Greeting message](./assets/5.2_04_GreetingMessage.png)

1. Update the greeting message to the following text,

   ```text
    Welcome to Contoso IT Concierge. Whether you're experiencing a technical issue or looking for a device, I'll help you find the right solution or next step. How can I assist you today?
   ```

    ![Update Greeting message](./assets/5.2_05_UpdateGreetingMessage.png)

    Exit from agent settings by selecting the **X** icon on the upper-right corner.

1. Let's review the other components of the agent. First, there are **Skills**, which define the agent's behavior through structured instructions that tell it how to handle specific tasks, apply logic, and respond consistently across different user requests. You'll learn more about skills in an upcoming mission.

    ![Skills added](./assets/5.2_06_ReviewSkills.png)

1. Select one of the generated skills (for example, **Escalation ticket summary**) to open its details. Review the skill name, description, and the structured instructions that define how the agent should execute that behavior.

    ![Escalation ticket summary skills](./assets/5.2_07_EscalationTicketySummarySkill.png)

1. Next, there's **Knowledge**. The SharePoint site and websites as knowledge sources were defined during the authoring experience but let's add another knowledge source.

### 5.3 Add an internal knowledge source by uploading a document

We'll now add another internal knowledge source by uploading a document directly to our agent.

1. In the **Knowledge** section, select **+** icon.

    ![Select plus icon to add knowledge](./assets/5.3_01_AddKnowledge.png)

1. Select **Click to upload**.

    ![Select Click to upload](./assets/5.3_02_SelectUploadFile.png)

1. Download this [sample file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/agent-academy/refs/heads/main/docs/recruit/06-create-agent-from-conversation/assets/Contoso_Guest_WiFi_Connection_Guide.docx) and select it in your File Explorer. Select **Open**.

    ![Select document](./assets/5.3_04_SelectWordFile.png)

1. The file has been selected for upload. Select **Add to agent** next.

    ![Select Add to Agent](./assets/5.3_05_SelectAddToAgent.png)

1. The document has now been added as a knowledge source to your agent.

    ![Word file added as knowledge source](./assets/5.3_06_WordFileAdded.png)

Let's now test our agent!

### 5.4 Test agent

We'll now test our updated agent and how it answers questions using each connected knowledge source.

1. Select the **Preview** tab. We'll see our updated greeting message.

    Enter the following question to test our public website (external) knowledge source.

   ```text
   How can I check the warranty status of my Surface?
   ```

    ![Test website knowledge source](./assets/5.4_01_TestWebsiteKnowledgeSource.png)

1. The agent reviews the knowledge sources and responds using the website knowledge source. Notice the **Citations** reference the Microsoft Support web page it formed its answer from.

   ![Citations](./assets/5.4_02_Citations.png)

1. Let's now test both our SharePoint site knowledge source and document knowledge source in a single message. Enter the following question.

   ```text
   How can I access our company's Contoso VPN from my device? And what are the Guest Wi-Fi details?
   ```

    ![Test SharePoint site and Word file knowledge sources](./assets/5.4_03_TestSharePointAndWordFileKnowledgeSources.png)

1. Scroll through the response. The **Contoso VPN Access** section is grounded using the **Contoso IT** SharePoint site, and the **Contoso Guest Wi-Fi** section is grounded using the uploaded document. The **Citations** list both sources separately - **Frequently-asked-questions.aspx** (SharePoint) and **Contoso_Guest_WiFi_Connection_Guide.docx** (document).

   ![Guest wifi response and citations](./assets/5.4_04_SharePointCitation.png)

1. It's always good to verify the generated response is correct. Review the inline `[n]` citation markers and the **Citations** bar to see exactly which source grounded each part of the answer. For web and SharePoint citations, selecting the citation opens the source page so you can confirm the information.

The agent can answer multiple questions in a single message, search the knowledge sources, and cite the sources it used in its response. Make sure to always verify the response is correct by reviewing the citations.

### 5.5 Review solution

Before moving to the next mission, take a look at the solution to see the agent components.

1. Select the **ellipsis** icon on the left-hand side menu and select **Solutions**.

    ![Navigate to solutions](./assets/5.5_01_SelectSolutions.png)

1. Select the **Contoso IT Concierge Agent** solution.

    ![Select solution](./assets/5.5_02_SelectSolution.png)

1. The solution shows all components that belong to this agent in one place, and you'll see the uploaded Word file listed there as well. Think of a solution as your ALM package: it groups the agent and related components together so you can track changes, move them between environments (dev, test, production), and deploy consistently.

    ![Solution components](./assets/5.5_03_SolutionObjects.png)
