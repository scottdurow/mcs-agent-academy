## 🎯 Mission Brief {#mission-brief}

Welcome, Agent. Your first assignment is **Operation Talent Scout** - establishing the foundational infrastructure for an AI-powered recruitment system that will transform how organizations identify and hire top talent.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to deploy and configure a comprehensive hiring management system using Microsoft Copilot Studio. You'll import a pre-built solution containing all the necessary data structures, then create your first AI agent - the **Hiring Agent** - which will serve as the central orchestrator for all future recruitment operations.

This initial deployment establishes the solution that you'll enhance throughout the Agent Academy Operative course. Consider this your base of operations - the foundation upon which you'll build an entire network of specialized agents in subsequent missions.

> [!IMPORTANT] This lesson uses the classic Copilot Studio experience
> Microsoft Copilot Studio is rolling out a new authoring experience. The screenshots and steps in this lesson use the **classic experience**. If your screen looks different, turn off **New Experience** in the upper-right corner before you continue. Refreshed instructions for the new experience are planned, but this lesson remains valid in the classic experience.

## 🔎 Objectives {#objectives}

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. About the scenario and gain comprehensive knowledge of hiring automation challenges and solutions
1. How to successfully import and configure the fundamentals of a hiring management system
1. How to build a hiring agent that is the start of the scenario you're going to build as an Agent Academy Operative

## 🔍 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before embarking on this mission, ensure you have:

- Copilot Studio license
- Access to a Microsoft Power Platform environment that is **not** a managed environment
- Administrative permissions to create solutions and agents

> [!TIP] Prerequisites help:
> If you need help getting a Copilot Studio license, please reference the [Recruit Course Setup lab](./../../recruit/00-course-setup/index.md) which walks you through setting up a Power Platform environment with a Copilot Studio trial.

## 🏢 Understanding the Hiring Automation Scenario {#understanding-the-hiring-automation-scenario}

This scenario demonstrates how a company can use Microsoft Copilot Studio full to improve and automate its hiring process. It introduces a system of agents that work together to handle tasks like reviewing resumes, recommending job roles, preparing interview materials, and evaluating candidates.

### Business Value

The solution helps HR teams save time and make better decisions by:

- Automatically processing resumes received via email.
- Suggesting suitable job roles based on candidate profiles.
- Creating job applications and interview guides tailored to each candidate.
- Ensuring fair and compliant hiring practices through built-in safety and moderation features.
- Collecting feedback to improve the solution.

### How It Works

- A central **Hiring Agent** coordinates the process and stores data in Microsoft Dataverse.
- An **Application Intake Agent** reads resumes and creates job applications.
- An **Interview Prep Agent** generates interview questions and documents based on the candidate's background.
- The system can be published to a demo website, allowing stakeholders to interact with it.

This scenario is ideal for organizations looking to modernize their recruitment workflows using AI-powered automation, while maintaining transparency, fairness, and efficiency.

## 🧪 Lab 1 - Setup the Hiring Agent {#lab-1-setup-the-hiring-agent}

In this hands-on lab, you'll establish the foundation for your hiring automation system. You'll begin by importing a pre-configured solution that contains all the necessary Dataverse tables and data structure for managing candidates, job positions, and hiring workflows. Next, you'll populate these tables with sample data that will support your learning throughout this module and provide realistic scenarios for testing. Finally, you'll create the Hiring Agent in Copilot Studio, setting up the basic conversational interface that will serve as the cornerstone for all the other features you'll add in future missions.

### 🧪 Lab 1.1 - Import solution {#lab-11-import-solution}

1. Go to **[Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)**
1. Select the **...** in the left navigation and select **Solutions**

    ![Solutions tab](./assets/01-solutionstab.png)

    > On success, you will see a green notification bar with the following message when it's done: "Solution "Operative" imported successfully."

1. Once you see the "imported successfully" message, take a look at what you imported by selecting the display name of the solution (`Operative`) in the solutions list.

![Open Solution](./assets/01-selectsolution.png)

Review the solution and ensure that the following components are imported:

![Imported tables](./assets/components.png)

| Display Name | Type | Description |

### 🧪 Lab 1.3 - Create the hiring agent {#lab-13-create-the-hiring-agent}

Now you are done with the setup of the prerequisites, it's time for the actual work! Let's add our Hiring Agent first!

1. Go to **[Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)** and make sure you are in the same environment as where you imported the solution and the data

    ![Agent settings](./assets/01-agentsettings.png)

1. Select **Confirm and create**

    This should create your agent in the *Operative* solution. It will create an agent named *Agent 1*. This is not a very useful name, so let's change that!

1. In the *Details* card at the top, select **Edit**
1. For **Name**, enter:

    ```text
    Hiring Agent
    ```
