# 🚨 Mission 01: Introduction to Agents

## 🕵️‍♂️ CODENAME: `OPERATION AI AGENT DECODE`

> **⏱️ Operation Time Window:** `~15 minutes – intel only, no fieldwork required`

## 🎯 Mission Brief

Welcome, Recruit.

This mission is about **how to think about agents**.

We aren't opening Copilot Studio just yet. Before you start building, you need the core concepts, because the product only really clicks once you understand the ideas behind it.

And those ideas have changed.

A couple of years ago, “building a bot” usually meant designing a conversation tree. You mapped out what the user might say, wrote scripted responses, and tried to predict every possible path.

Today, an **agent** works differently. It can reason over what someone is trying to accomplish, use trusted data, choose from available tools, and take action.

That means our job has changed too.

We aren't just scripting dialogue anymore. We're setting goals, providing capabilities, grounding the agent in the right knowledge, and defining the boundaries it needs to operate safely and effectively.

By the end of this mission, you will understand what makes agents different, why that shift matters, and how to start thinking like an agent builder.


## 🔎 Objectives

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. The difference between a chatbot, an AI assistant, and an **agent**
1. How Large Language Models (LLMs) act as an agent's "brain"
1. How Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) keeps answers grounded and current
1. What **orchestration** is, and why generative orchestration replaced the topic tree
1. The **agent spectrum** from reactive to autonomous, and the control boundaries that keep it safe
1. The common Microsoft build surfaces for agents, from **no-code** to **pro-code**
1. The two paths you'll build in this course: **declarative** vs. **custom** agents

Let's decode it.

## Chatbot vs. AI Assistant vs. Agent

These words often get used interchangeably but they're not the same.

- **Chatbot** — Matches your phrase to a pre-written answer or a branch in a scripted flow. Predictable, but brittle: say it differently and it breaks.
- **AI Assistant** — Uses an LLM to respond fluently to almost anything, but mostly helps through conversation. Some assistants can call tools (like agents, MCP servers, etc), but they usually do less planning, delegation, or autonomous follow-through than an agent.
- **Agent** — Reasons about your goal, decides which **knowledge** to consult and which **tools** to use, and may execute a multi-step plan. Some agents can also act on a **trigger**, like a schedule, new email, or new record, without you typing anything at all.

> [!INFO] The one-line definition
> An **agent** is an LLM given a goal, a set of tools and knowledge, and the autonomy to decide how to use them within boundaries you set.

## The Brain: Large Language Models (LLMs)

Modern agents are built around an LLM: a neural network trained on enormous amounts of text that predicts language one **token** at a time. A few concepts you'll lean on later:

- **Tokens & context window** — Models read and write in tokens (word fragments). The **context window** is how much it can "hold in mind" at once. These context windows are often pretty large, but not infinite. Long conversations and large documents can get summarized or dropped if the context window gets too big.
- **Instructions** — You don't just ask an agent a question; you give it standing **instructions** (its persona, rules, and how to behave). This is the single biggest lever on agent quality.
- **Not all models are equal** — Some are fast and cheap for chat. **Reasoning models** are optimized for more complex, multi-step tasks where planning, analysis, and careful tool use matter. Choosing the right model for the job is important.

> [!TIP] The autocomplete analogy
> An LLM is a "super-smart autocomplete": it doesn't *understand* like a human, it predicts the next best token. That's why **clear instructions and good grounding matter more than clever phrasing** because you're steering a prediction engine, not briefing a colleague.

## The Memory: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

An LLM only knows what it was trained on, which is frozen in time and knows nothing about *your* organization. **RAG** fixes that by letting the agent look things up before it answers:

1. **Ask** — The user poses a question.
1. **Retrieve** — The agent searches a **knowledge source** (your SharePoint, OneDrive, Dataverse, a website, a database) for relevant information.
1. **Augment** — That information is added to the model's context.
1. **Generate** — The model answers using that retrieved evidence (ideally **with citations**) back to the source.

This is the difference between an agent that *guesses* and one that *cites its sources*. In Copilot Studio this is called the **knowledge layer**, and it's read-only by design: knowledge informs answers, **tools** take actions. Keep those two ideas separate, it'll save you grief later.

## The Director: Orchestration

Here's the concept that changed everything. **Orchestration** is the layer that decides *what the agent does* with a request: which knowledge to pull, which tools to call, in what order.

In the old world, *you* were the orchestrator. You hand-authored a **topic** for every path the conversation could take. It worked until it didn't: too many topics, too many exceptions, and the whole thing fell apart the moment a user phrased something unexpectedly.

**Generative orchestration** flips this. An LLM acts as a **planner**: it reads the user's intent, looks at the knowledge, tools, and sub-agents available to it, and composes a plan on the fly:

> **plan → act → observe → replan**

You no longer script the path. You supply good building blocks like clearly named tools, well-described knowledge, sharp instructions, and let the planner assemble them. This is the most important shift in the course, and it changes the job:

> [!INFO] Your job changed
> You've gone from **writing the script** to **defining the operating environment**. Agent quality now lives in the quality of your *instructions, tool names, and data boundaries*, not in how many conversation branches you drew. A vaguely described tool isn't bad documentation anymore; it's a bad instruction handed to the planner.

## The Agent Spectrum

It's tempting to sort agents into two bins: "conversational" and "autonomous." The better way to think of it is a **dial**. The same agent can answer a chat now and run a scheduled job later. What varies is *how much it decides on its own*.

|                 | More **reactive**                         | More **autonomous**                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Starts from** | A user message                            | A trigger (schedule, new email, new record)               |
| **Good for**    | Q&A, guided help, support                 | Multi-step jobs, monitoring, back-office automation       |
| **Human role**  | In the conversation                       | Reviewing outcomes, approving high-stakes steps           |
| **Example**     | Teams agent answering HR-policy questions | Agent that triages an inbox and drafts replies for review |

Because autonomy cuts both ways, you set **control boundaries**, deciding, per action, whether the agent can:

- **Just do it** (low-risk: look up an answer, summarize a doc),
- **Ask first** (medium-risk: confirm before sending or changing something), or
- **Escalate** (high-risk: a human must approve—e.g., a payment or a deletion).

> [!TIP] Opinion: design the boundaries before the capabilities
> The failure mode of agentic AI isn't a wrong sentence, it's a confident wrong *action* against a real system. Decide what the agent is allowed to do **before** you wire up what it *can* do.

## Two Paths You'll Build: Declarative vs. Custom

This course builds both kinds of agent, so meet them now as *concepts* (the how-to is in later missions):

- **Declarative agent** — You *declare* the agent's instructions, knowledge, and actions, and it runs on **Microsoft 365 Copilot's** orchestrator and models. Fastest path to value; lives natively inside M365 Copilot. *(Not built in this course — try it at [Copilot Camp](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-camp/pages/extend-m365-copilot/01-first-agent-builder/).)*
- **Custom agent** — You configure the agent's instructions, knowledge, tools, triggers, topics, actions, and orchestration behavior. This gives you more control over the agent experience, business process integration, channels, governance, and how the agent handles work beyond a simple Microsoft 365 Copilot declarative agent. *(This is the focus of the rest of the course.)*

> [!INFO] Pro-code note
> For fully code-driven agents where you bring your own orchestrator, model choices, runtime, and deployment architecture, you move into custom engine agents, Microsoft 365 Agents SDK, Agent Framework, or Microsoft Foundry.

The rule of thumb: **start declarative when you want the fastest path inside Microsoft 365 Copilot**. Move to **Copilot Studio** when you need more control over business logic, actions, topics, triggers, governance, or channels. Move to a **custom engine or pro-code path** when you need full control over orchestration, model choice, runtime, or architecture.

## Where Agents Get Built

There are **multiple ways to build agents**, and they sit across a spectrum from **no-code** to **pro-code**.

- **Agent Builder in Microsoft 365 Copilot** — A simple, approachable starting point for creating agents right inside the Microsoft 365 experience. Good for quick experiments and lightweight productivity scenarios.
- **Copilot Studio** — Microsoft's low-code platform for building business-ready agents with instructions, knowledge, actions, orchestration, and governance controls.
- **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK + Agents Toolkit** — A pro-code path for developers who want to build agents in code and use Microsoft tooling to scaffold, test, and package them.
- **Microsoft Foundry / Foundry Agent Service** — An advanced AI agent platform for teams that need deeper control over models, frameworks, hosting, tools, runtime, infrastructure, and custom AI application architecture.

The simplest way to think about it is this: **Agent Builder** is a great starting point, **Copilot Studio** gives you more control without requiring a fully code-first approach, and the **SDK/toolkit** and **Foundry** paths are for teams that want deeper developer control.

Now that you've seen the two agent types, you can map the tools to them more clearly: **Agent Builder** creates **declarative agents** for Microsoft 365 Copilot. **Copilot Studio** can create **declarative agents** and more advanced **custom agents**. **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK + Agents Toolkit** can support declarative agents and custom engine agents. **Microsoft Foundry / Foundry Agent Service** is typically used when teams need deeper control over models, frameworks, hosting, tools, runtime, or agent architecture.

These also aren't the only tools available. There are more specialized options, like **Custom SharePoint Agents** for SharePoint-centric scenarios, **Microsoft Agent Framework** for fully code-driven agent and workflow development, and other ecosystem-specific frameworks.

The important point is not memorizing every product. It's understanding that agent development spans **no-code, low-code, and pro-code approaches**, and each has strengths:

- **No-code** tools help you get started fast and validate ideas quickly.
- **Low-code** tools balance speed with more control, integration, and governance.
- **Pro-code** tools give developers the deepest flexibility when they need custom architectures, advanced logic, or specialized deployment patterns.

This course is focused on **building agents with Copilot Studio**. We'll go deeper into **what Copilot Studio is and how it works in Mission 02**, and we'll also touch on **Agent Builder** as a useful starting point for simpler scenarios and early experimentation.

## Why This Lands in Microsoft 365

Concepts are universal, but in this course the agents you build **meet people where they already work**: in **Microsoft Teams** and the **Microsoft 365 Copilot** experience, grounded in Work IQ, acting through your connected tools, and bound by your organization's identity and permissions. An agent that's brilliant in isolation but invisible in the flow of work doesn't get used. That integration is the payoff and the subject of the rest of the curriculum.

## 🎉 Mission Complete

You now have the mental model. You can explain:

1. **Agent ≠ chatbot ≠ AI assistant** — an agent reasons, retrieves, uses tools, and may self-start when triggers are configured.
1. **LLM = the brain**, steered by instructions and model choice.
1. **RAG = the memory** — grounded, cited answers from *your* data (the knowledge layer).
1. **Generative orchestration = the director** — a planner that composes tools and knowledge instead of a hand-drawn topic tree.
1. **Agency is a spectrum** — set control boundaries before capabilities.
1. **Declarative vs. custom** — start simple, move to Copilot Studio or pro-code paths when you need more control.

Next up, you'll dig into **Copilot Studio** — what it is, how it works, and the building blocks you'll use for the rest of the custom-agent track: [**Mission 02: Copilot Studio Fundamentals**](../02-copilot-studio-fundamentals/index.md).
